  abstract = {Objective To assess implementation of provider‐initiated testing and counselling (PITC) for HIV in Malawi. Methods A review of PITC practices within 118 departments in 12 Ministry of Health (MoH) facilities across Malawi was conducted. Information on PITC practices was collected via a health facility survey. Data describing patient visits and HIV tests were abstracted from routinely collected programme data. Results Reported PITC practices were highly variable. Most providers practiced symptom‐based PITC. Antenatal clinics and maternity wards reported widespread use of routine opt‐out PITC. In 2014, there was approximately 1 HIV test for every 15 clinic visits. HIV status was ascertained in 94.3\% (5293/5615) of patients at tuberculosis clinics, 92.6\% (30 675/33 142) of patients at antenatal clinics and 49.4\% (6871/13 914) of patients at sexually transmitted infection clinics. Reported challenges to delivering PITC included test kit shortages (71/71 providers), insufficient physical space (58/71) and inadequate number of HIV counsellors (32/71) while providers from inpatient units cited the inability to test on weekends. Conclusions Various models of PITC currently exist at MoH facilities in Malawi. Only antenatal and maternity clinics demonstrated high rates of routine opt‐out PITC. The low ratio of facility visits to HIV tests suggests missed opportunities for HIV testing. However, the high proportion of patients at TB and antenatal clinics with known HIV status suggests that routine PITC is feasible. These results underscore the need to develop clear, standardised PITC policy and protocols, and to address obstacles of limited health commodities, infrastructure and human resources.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently there are very limited empirical data available on the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis among residents of marginalized settings in Pakistan. This study assessed the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis through active case detection and evaluated predictors of pulmonary tuberculosis among residents of two peri-urban neighbourhoods of Karachi, Pakistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two peri-urban neighbourhoods from May 2002 to November 2002. Systematic sampling design was used to select households for inclusion in the study. Consenting subjects aged 15 years or more from selected households were interviewed and, whenever possible, sputum samples were obtained. Sputum samples were subjected to direct microscopy by Ziehl-Neelson method, bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity tests. RESULTS: The prevalence (per 100,000) of pulmonary tuberculosis among the subjects aged 15 years or more, who participated in the study was 329 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 195-519). The prevalence (per 100,000) of pulmonary tuberculosis adjusted for non-sampling was 438 (95\% CI: 282-651). Other than cough, none of the other clinical variables was significantly associated with pulmonary tuberculosis status. Analysis of drug sensitivity pattern of 15 strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed that one strain was resistant to isoniazid alone, one to streptomycin alone and one was resistant to isoniazid and streptomycin. The remaining 12 strains were susceptible to all five drugs including streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. CONCLUSION: This study of previously undetected tuberculosis cases in an impoverished peri-urban setting reveals the poor operational performance of Pakistan's current approach to tuberculosis control; it also demonstrates a higher prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis than current national estimates. Public health authorities may wish to augment health education efforts aimed at prompting health-seeking behaviour to facilitate more complete and earlier case detection. Such efforts to improve passive case-finding, if combined with more accessible DOTS infra-structure for treatment of detected cases, may help to diminish the high tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality in marginalized populations. The economics of implementing a more active approach to case finding in resource-constrained setting also deserve further study.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are at an increased risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB). It is known that treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI), also referred to as TB preventive therapy or chemoprophylaxis, helps to prevent progression to active disease in HIV negative populations. However, the extent and magnitude of protection (if any) associated with preventive therapy in those infected with HIV should be quantified. This present study is an update of the original review. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of TB preventive therapy in reducing the risk of active tuberculosis and death in HIV-infected persons. SEARCH STRATEGY: This review was updated using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AIDSLINE, AIDSTRIALS, AIDSearch, NLM Gateway and AIDSDRUGS (publication date from 01 July 2002 to 04 April 2008). We also scanned reference lists of articles and contacted authors and other researchers in the field in an attempt to identify additional studies that may be eligible for inclusion in this review. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials in which HIV positive individuals were randomly allocated to TB preventive therapy or placebo, or to alternative TB preventive therapy regimens. Participants could be tuberculin skin test positive or negative, but without active tuberculosis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three reviewers independently applied the study selection criteria, assessed study quality and extracted data. Effects were assessed using relative risk for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data. MAIN RESULTS: 12 trials were included with a total of 8578 randomized participants. TB preventive therapy (any anti-TB drug) versus placebo was associated with a lower incidence of active TB (RR 0.68, 95\% CI 0.54 to 0.85). This benefit was more pronounced in individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test (RR 0.38, 95\% CI 0.25 to 0.57) than in those who had a negative test (RR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.64 to 1.24). Efficacy was similar for all regimens (regardless of drug type, frequency or duration of treatment). However, compared to INH monotherapy, short-course multi-drug regimens were much more likely to require discontinuation of treatment due to adverse effects. Although there was reduction in mortality with INH monotherapy versus placebo among individuals with a positive tuberculin skin test (RR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.55 to 1.00) and with INH plus rifampicin versus placebo regardless of tuberculin skin test status (RR 0.69, 95\% CI 0.50 to 0.95), overall, there was no evidence that TB preventive therapy versus placebo reduced all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.85 to 1.05). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of latent tuberculosis infection reduces the risk of active TB in HIV positive individuals especially in those with a positive tuberculin skin test. The choice of regimen will depend on factors such as availability, cost, adverse effects, adherence and drug resistance. Future studies should assess these aspects. In addition, trials evaluating the long-term effects of anti-tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis, the optimal duration of TB preventive therapy, the influence of level of immunocompromise on effectiveness and combination of anti-tuberculosis chemoprophylaxis with antiretroviral therapy are needed.},

  abstract = {In the first nationwide community-based survey of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in Saudi Arabia, 7721 subjects were screened in the 5 provinces (using an equal proportional allocation formula) for 2 parameters: (1) prevalence of positive Mantoux test in non BCG vaccinated subjects; (2) prevalence of bacillary cases on sputum culture. The prevalence of positive Mantoux reaction in children aged 5-14 years was 6\% +/- 1.8; higher in urban areas (10\%), and lower in rural areas (2\%), thus classifying Saudi Arabia among the middle prevalence countries. These relatively good results (by Third World standards) could reflect the rise of the standard of living and wide availability of free treatment for active cases with a lowered risk of infection in the community. This view is supported by the fact that in our survey, only one subject grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the sputum. However, there were foci of high prevalence of Mantoux reaction in the urban communities in the Western province (20\% +/- 8.7 urban; 1\% +/- 1.9 rural). The problem may be caused by the fact that the province receives every year over a million pilgrims, some of whom are known to settle illegally and escape the usual screening for tuberculosis imposed on foreign labourers. In conclusion, even in the absence of an enforceable national programme for the eradication of tuberculosis, the economic standard and wide availability of free treatment for active cases has resulted in relatively low rates of prevalence of tuberculin sensitivity in children. The foci of high prevalence in the Western Province require special screening arrangements.},

A hackathon was thus organised to solicit the development and comparison of several models for small area estimation of TB. The TB hackathon was launched in April 2019. Participating teams were requested to produce district-level estimates of bacteriologically positive TB prevalence among adults (over 15 years of age) for 2018. The NTP provided case-based data from their 2010\&ndash;2011 TB prevalence survey, along with data relating to TB screening, testing and treatment for the period between 2010\&ndash;2011 and 2018. Five teams submitted district-level TB prevalence estimates, methodological details and programming code. Although the geographical distribution of TB prevalence varied considerably across models, we identified several districts with consistently low notification-to-prevalence ratios. The hackathon highlighted the challenges of generating granular spatiotemporal TB prevalence forecasts based on a cross-sectional prevalence survey data and other data sources. Nevertheless, it provided a range of approaches to subnational disease modelling. The NTP\&rsquo;s use and plans for these outputs shows that, limitations notwithstanding, they can be valuable for programme planning.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: WHO estimates that a third of the world's population has latent tuberculosis infection and that less than 5\% of those infected are diagnosed and treated to prevent tuberculosis. We aimed to systematically review studies that report the steps from initial tuberculosis screening through to treatment for latent tuberculosis infection, which we call the latent tuberculosis cascade of care. We specifically aimed to assess the number of people lost at each stage of the cascade. METHODS: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of study-level observational data. We searched MEDLINE (via OVID), Embase, and Health Star for observational studies, published between 1946 and April 12, 2015, that reported primary data for diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection. We did meta-analyses using random and fixed effects analyses to identify percentages of patients with latent tuberculosis infection completing each step in the cascade. We also estimated pooled proportions in subgroups stratified by different characteristics of interest to assess risk factors for losses. RESULTS: We identified 58 studies, describing 70 distinct cohorts and 748\hphantom{,}572 people. Steps in the cascade associated with greater losses included completion of testing (71·9\% [95\% CI 71·8-72·0] of people intended for screening), completion of medical evaluation (43·7\% [42·5-44·9]), recommendation for treatment (35·0\% [33·8-36·4]), and completion of treatment if started (18·8\% [16·3-19·7]). Steps with fewer losses included receiving test results, referral for evaluation if test positive, and accepting to start therapy if recommended. Factors associated with fewer losses were immune-compromising medical indications, being part of contact investigations, and use of rifamycin-based regimens. INTERPRETATION: We identify major losses at several steps in the cascade of care for latent tuberculosis infection. Improvements in management of latent tuberculosis will need programmatic approaches to address the losses at each step in the cascade. FUNDERS: Canadian Institutes of Health Research.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite international recommendations, coverage of syphilis testing in pregnant women and treatment of those found seropositive remains limited in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed whether combining the provision of supplies with a behavioural intervention was more effective than providing supplies only, to improve syphilis screening and treatment during antenatal care. METHODS: In this 18-month, cluster randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) 26 urban antenatal care clinics in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Lusaka, Zambia, to receive a behavioural intervention (opinion leader selection, academic detailing visits, reminders, audits and feedback, and supportive supervision) plus supplies for syphilis testing and treatment (intervention group) or to receive supplies only (control group). The primary outcomes were proportion of pregnant women who had syphilis screening out of the total who attended the clinic; and the proportion of women who had treatment with benzathine benzylpenicillin out of those who tested positive for syphilis at their first antenatal care visit. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02353117. FINDINGS: The 18-month study period was Feb 1, 2016, to July 14, 2017. 18\hphantom{,}357 women were enrolled at the 13 intervention clinics and 17\hphantom{,}679 women were enrolled at the 13 control clinics at their first antenatal care visit. Syphilis screening was done in a median of 99·9\% (IQR 99·0-100·0) of women in the intervention clinics and 93·8\% (85·0-98·9) in the control clinics (absolute difference 6·1\% [95\% CI 1·1-14·1]; p=0·00092). Syphilis treatment at the first visit was done in a median of 100\% (IQR 99·7-100·0) of seropositive women in intervention clinics and 43·2\% (2·6-83·2) of seropositive women in control clinics (absolute difference 56·8\% [12·8-99·0]; p=0·0028). INTERPRETATION: A behavioural intervention, together with the provision of supplies, can lead to more than 95\% of women being screened and treated for syphilis. The sole provision of supplies is sufficient to reach such levels of screening coverage but is not sufficient to ensure high levels of treatment. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in the Shimshal Valley. DESIGN: The Rapid Village Survey Method (RVS) was used to investigate the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis. The selection criteria were chronic cough, hemoptysis, past history of TB and close contact with a tuberculous patient. After clinical examination, a chest radiograph was done and a single spot sputum sample was obtained for smear examination. RESULTS: The total population of the village was 1077, of whom 231 cases were studied. Overcrowding affected 75\% of the study population. The prevalence of smear positive pulmonary TB in the village studied was 554 per 100000 population, and the prevalence of active smear-negative TB was estimated at 1949/100 000. The prevalence of active pulmonary TB increased with age and the only risk factor for active TB was age over 45 years. Of the 21 cases with a past history of pulmonary TB, only 38\% had completed a full course of chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary TB is a very serious health issue in the rural community (Shimshal Valley) of Pakistan. This study highlights the lack of efficacy of national tuberculosis control programs in the country.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death for individuals infected with Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Conversely, HIV is the most important risk factor in the progression of TB from the latent to the active status. In order to manage this double epidemic situation, an integrated approach that includes HIV management in TB patients was proposed by the World Health Organization and was implemented in Uganda (one of the countries endemic with both diseases). To enable targeted intervention using the integrated approach, areas with high disease prevalence rates for TB and HIV need to be identified first. However, there is no such study in Uganda, addressing the joint spatial patterns of these two diseases. METHODS: This study uses global Moran's index, spatial scan statistics and bivariate global and local Moran's indices to investigate the geographical clustering patterns of both diseases, as individuals and as combined. The data used are TB and HIV case data for 2015, 2016 and 2017 obtained from the District Health Information Software 2 system, housed and maintained by the Ministry of Health, Uganda. RESULTS: Results from this analysis show that while TB and HIV diseases are highly correlated (55-76\%), they exhibit relatively different spatial clustering patterns across Uganda. The joint TB/HIV prevalence shows consistent hotspot clusters around districts surrounding Lake Victoria as well as northern Uganda. These two clusters could be linked to the presence of high HIV prevalence among the fishing communities of Lake Victoria and the presence of refugees and internally displaced people camps, respectively. The consistent cold spot observed in eastern Uganda and around Kasese could be explained by low HIV prevalence in communities with circumcision tradition. CONCLUSIONS: This study makes a significant contribution to TB/HIV public health bodies around Uganda by identifying areas with high joint disease burden, in the light of TB/HIV co-infection. It, thus, provides a valuable starting point for an informed and targeted intervention, as a positive step towards a TB and HIV-AIDS free community.},

  abstract = {More than 10 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) are diagnosed worldwide each year. The majority of these cases occur in low- and middle-income countries where the TB epidemic is predominantly driven by transmission. Efforts to 'end TB' will depend upon our ability to halt ongoing transmission. However, recent studies of new approaches to interrupt transmission have demonstrated inconsistent effects on reducing population-level TB incidence. TB transmission occurs across a wide range of settings, that include households and hospitals, but also community-based settings. While home-based contact investigations and infection control programmes in hospitals and clinics have a successful track record as TB control activities, there is a gap in our knowledge of where, and between whom, community-based transmission of TB occurs. Novel tools, including molecular epidemiology, geospatial analyses and ventilation studies, provide hope for improving our understanding of transmission in countries where the burden of TB is greatest. By integrating these diverse and innovative tools, we can enhance our ability to identify transmission events by documenting the opportunity for transmission-through either an epidemiologic or geospatial connection-alongside genomic evidence for transmission, based upon genetically similar TB strains. A greater understanding of locations and patterns of transmission will translate into meaningful improvements in our current TB control activities by informing targeted, evidence-based public health interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Southern Africa has had an unprecedented increase in the burden of tuberculosis, driven by the HIV epidemic. The Zambia, South Africa Tuberculosis and AIDS Reduction (ZAMSTAR) trial examined two public health interventions that aimed to reduce the burden of tuberculosis by facilitating either rapid sputum diagnosis or integrating tuberculosis and HIV services within the community. METHODS: ZAMSTAR was a community-randomised trial done in Zambia and the Western Cape province of South Africa. Two interventions, community-level enhanced tuberculosis case-finding (ECF) and household level tuberculosis-HIV care, were implemented between Aug 1, 2006, and July 31, 2009, and assessed in a 2x2 factorial design between Jan 9, 2010, and Dec 6, 2010. All communities had a strengthened tuberculosis-HIV programme implemented in participating health-care centres. 24 communities, selected according to population size and tuberculosis notification rate, were randomly allocated to one of four study groups using a randomisation schedule stratified by country and baseline prevalence of tuberculous infection: group 1 strengthened tuberculosis-HIV programme at the clinic alone; group 2, clinic plus ECF; group 3, clinic plus household intervention; and group 4, clinic plus ECF and household interventions. The primary outcome was the prevalence of culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis in adults ({$>$}/=18 years), defined as Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from one respiratory sample, measured 4 years after the start of interventions in a survey of 4000 randomly selected adults in each community in 2010. The secondary outcome was the incidence of tuberculous infection, measured using tuberculin skin testing in a cohort of schoolchildren, a median of 4 years after a baseline survey done before the start of interventions. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN36729271. FINDINGS: Prevalence of tuberculosis was evaluated in 64,463 individuals randomly selected from the 24 communities; 894 individuals had active tuberculosis. Averaging over the 24 communities, the geometric mean of tuberculosis prevalence was 832 per 100,000 population. The adjusted prevalence ratio for the comparison of ECF versus non-ECF intervention groups was 1.09 (95\% CI 0.86-1.40) and of household versus non-household intervention groups was 0.82 (0.64-1.04). The incidence of tuberculous infection was measured in a cohort of 8809 children, followed up for a median of 4 years; the adjusted rate ratio for ECF versus non-ECF groups was 1.36 (95\% CI 0.59-3.14) and for household versus non-household groups was 0.45 (0.20-1.05). INTERPRETATION: Although neither intervention led to a statistically significant reduction in tuberculosis, two independent indicators of burden provide some evidence of a reduction in tuberculosis among communities receiving the household intervention. By contrast the ECF intervention had no effect on either outcome. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Stop TB Partnership target for tuberculosis is to have reduced the prevalence of tuberculosis by 50\% comparing 2015 to 1990. This target is challenging as few prevalence surveys have been conducted, especially in high burden tuberculosis and HIV countries. Current tuberculosis control strategies in high HIV prevalent settings are therefore based on limited epidemiological evidence and more evidence is needed from community-based surveys to inform improved policy formulation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: 8044 adults were sampled from 2 sub-districts (wards) in Lusaka province, Zambia. Questionnaires were used to screen for symptoms, respiratory samples were obtained for culture and oral secretions collected for HIV testing. 79 individuals were found to have Mycobacterium tuberculosis in their sputum, giving an adjusted overall prevalence of tuberculosis of 870/100,000 (95\% CI 570-1160/100,000). The adjusted overall prevalence of HIV was 28.61\% (95\% CI 26.04-31.19). HIV- infection was significantly associated with prevalent tuberculosis (Adj OR 2.3, 95\% CI 1.42-3.74) and the population attributable fraction of HIV for prevalent tuberculosis was 36\%. Symptoms such as prolonged cough (adj OR 12.72, 95\% CI 7.05-22.94) and fever (Adj OR 2.04, 95\%CI 1.23-3.39), were associated with prevalent tuberculosis, but 8 (10\%) individuals with prevalent tuberculosis denied having any symptoms at all and only 34 (43\%) would have been classified as a TB suspect by current guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Undiagnosed tuberculosis is a challenge for tuberculosis control and new approaches are needed if we are to reach international targets. Epidemiological studies can inform screening algorithms for both detection and prevention of active tuberculosis.},

Interventions to reduce the impact of these diseases at community level are urgently needed. This paper presents the design of a community randomised trial to evaluate the impact of two complex interventions on the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in high HIV prevalence settings in Zambia and South Africa. METHODS: The interaction between TB and HIV is reviewed and possible interventions that could reduce the prevalence of TB in HIV-endemic populations are discussed. Two of these interventions are described in detail and the design of a 2 x 2 factorial community randomised trial to test these interventions is presented. The limitations and challenges of the design are identified and discussed. CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to reduce the prevalence of TB in communities highly affected by HIV. Potential interventions are complex and require innovative trial designs to provide the rigorous evidence needed to inform health policy makers and to ensure that resources are used optimally.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In highly resource-limited settings, many clinics lack same-day microbiological testing for active tuberculosis (TB). In these contexts, risk of pretreatment loss to follow-up is high, and a simple, easy-to-use clinical risk score could be useful. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data from adults tested for TB with Xpert MTB/RIF across 28 primary health clinics in rural South Africa (between July 2016 and January 2018). We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression to identify characteristics associated with Xpert-confirmed TB and converted coefficients into a simple score. We assessed discrimination using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration using Cox linear logistic regression, and clinical utility using decision curves. We validated the score externally in a population of adults tested for TB across 4 primary health clinics in urban Uganda (between May 2018 and December 2019). Model development was repeated de novo with the Ugandan population to compare clinical scores. The South African and Ugandan cohorts included 701 and 106 individuals who tested positive for TB, respectively, and 686 and 281 randomly selected individuals who tested negative. Compared to the Ugandan cohort, the South African cohort was older (41\% versus 19\% aged 45 years or older), had similar breakdown of biological sex (48\% versus 50\% female), and had higher HIV prevalence (45\% versus 34\%). The final prediction model, scored from 0 to 10, included 6 characteristics: age, sex, HIV (2 points), diabetes, number of classical TB symptoms (cough, fever, weight loss, and night sweats; 1 point each), and {$>$}14-day symptom duration. Discrimination was moderate in the derivation (c-statistic = 0.82, 95\% CI = 0.81 to 0.82) and validation (c-statistic = 0.75, 95\% CI = 0.69 to 0.80) populations. A patient with 10\% pretest probability of TB would have a posttest probability of 4\% with a score of 3/10 versus 43\% with a score of 7/10. The de novo Ugandan model contained similar characteristics and performed equally well. Our study may be subject to spectrum bias as we only included a random sample of people without TB from each cohort. This score is only meant to guide management while awaiting microbiological results, not intended as a community-based triage test (i.e., to identify individuals who should receive further testing). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that a simple clinical risk score reasonably distinguished individuals with and without TB among those submitting sputum for diagnosis. Subject to prospective validation, this score might be useful in settings with constrained diagnostic resources where concern for pretreatment loss to follow-up is high.},

OBJECTIVES: To examine gender differences in tuberculosis among adults aged {$>$}14 years with respect to infection and disease prevalence, health care service access, care seeking behaviour, diagnostic delay, convenience of directly observed treatment (DOT), stigma and treatment adherence. METHODS: Data were collected from 1) community survey, 2) self-referred out-patients seeking care at governmental primary health institutions (PHIs), 3) tuberculosis suspects referred for sputum microscopy at PHIs, and 4) tuberculosis patients notified under DOTS. Community survey results were compared with those for patients notified at PHIs. RESULTS: In the community, 66\% of males and 57\% of females had tuberculosis infection. The prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis was 568 and 87/100,000, respectively, among males and females. Fewer males than females attended PHIs (68 men for every 100 women). Females constituted 13\% of all smear-positive patients detected in the community survey, and 20\% of those detected at PHIs (P {$<$} 0.05). The probability of notification decreased significantly with age among both males and females. Significantly more females than males felt inhibited discussing their illness with family (21\% vs. 14\%) and needed to be accompanied for DOT (11\% vs. 6\%). Males had twice the risk of treatment default than females (19\% vs. 8\%; P {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite facing greater stigma and inconvenience, women were more likely than men to access health services, be notified under DOTS and adhere to treatment. Men and elderly patients need additional support to access diagnostic and DOT services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to assess the tuberculosis (TB) burden and to provide an insight into the type of circulating M. tuberculosis species in urban slums of Bangladesh. We also aimed to test the feasibility of a larger transmission study in this setting. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in an urban slum of Dhaka city. The household members were actively screened to assess the presence of TB-related signs and symptoms; cough {$>$}/= 3 weeks and body mass index (BMI) {$<$}17 kg/m(2). Sputum specimens from suspects were collected for acid fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy, culture and drug susceptibility testing. Genotyping of M. tuberculosis was done using spoligotyping and variable number tandem repeats of mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units typing. RESULTS: Among 9,877 adult screened for pulmonary TB (PTB), 25 were positive for AFB on microscopy and/or culture and the prevalence of new PTB cases was estimated to be 253/100,000. Only one child TB case was diagnosed among 5,147 child screened. Out of 26 cases, 21(81\%) had cough for several duration and 5(19\%) did not present with cough at the time of screening. One multidrug resistant case was found. Fifty two percent of all TB cases had BMI {$<$}17 kg/m2 (p = {$<$}0.001). Among the 20 analyzed isolates, 13 different spoligotype patterns were identified in which 5 clusters contained 12 strains and 8 strains had unique pattern. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed high prevalence of TB in urban slums. Screening using low BMI can be beneficial among risk group population. It is important to conduct larger study to validate clinical variables like cough {$<$}3 weeks and low BMI to define TB suspect and also to investigate the transmission of TB in slum settings.},

  abstract = {SETTING: Surui Indians, Amazonia, Brazil. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and the annual risk of infection (ARI) of tuberculosis (TB) in an indigenous population in Brazil. METHODS: We applied a method to estimate the prevalence of TB infection in populations with high bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine coverage. The method consisted of comparing levels of skin test reactivity in individuals tested with purified protein derivative (PPD) before and after stimulation with intradermal BCG. Fieldwork was carried out among the Surui Indians (n = 993) in two phases, 3 months apart. RESULTS: A total of 645 subjects were tested. In pre-BCG revaccination, tuberculin skin test (TST) indurations averaged 5.9 mm (33.5\% {$>$} or =10 mm). In post-BCG revaccination TST, indurations averaged 9.4 mm (48.7\% {$>$} or =10 mm). Conversion from non-reactor to reactor was 54.4\%. The ARI ranged from 1.2\% to 2.2\%. In the logistic regression, age and history of TB were the strongest independent predictors of TB infection. BCG scar and the number of individuals per house were also associated with infection. CONCLUSION: Tuberculous transmission is very high in the Surui, surpassing the ARI reported for Brazil (0.6\%). The epidemiology of TB in this indigenous population is related to unfavourable social and economic conditions, as well as to deficient health care services.},

A total of 736 subjects (50.7\% females) were examined (80\% of the total population). TB suspects underwent standardised evaluation for the presence of signs and/or symptoms of active TB, including chest radiography, PPD skin test, sputum microscopy examination for acid-fast bacilli and mycobacterial culture. A Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine scar was detected in 699 individuals (95.0\%). Of all the individuals examined, 120 (16.3\%) had undergone previous TB treatment (46.7\% females). One hundred and nine individuals were assessed as TB suspects (52.3\% females). The survey identified six new cases of TB in the Surui (three men and three women). Five of the six cases came from only two of the ten villages. Mycobacterium tuberculosis colonies grew from 5 (4.6\%) samples (only two of which were also smear-positive) and mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis were isolated from 14 (12.8\%) samples. Diagnosis of TB based exclusively on clinical grounds was established only in the case of a 4-year-old girl. Based on this survey, the prevalence of active TB in the sampled group (N=736) was 815.2 per 100000.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fieldwork components included clinical assessment of TB (479 subjects, 89.3\% of the population = 1 year of age), analysis of medical health records, and ethnographic research. RESULTS: We found TB to constitute a major health risk, with moderately high annual risk of infection (0.94\%), moderate prevalence of infection, high percentage of X-ray images suggestive of TB (14.2\% in subjects {$>$} or = 10 years of age), and a relatively low percentage of individuals with reactive TB skin tests (16.6\% of reactions {$>$} or = 10 mm) despite high BCG vaccine coverage. We also found a high rate of TB patients showing no evidence of prior infection. Ethnographic interviews show that Xavante and biomedical health perspectives are simultaneously divergent in their etiologies but pragmatically compatible. CONCLUSION: Ineffective diagnosis procedures compromise the efficacy of existing TB prevention efforts and threaten to undermine otherwise favorable institutional and cultural conditions.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cancer and other life-limiting non-communicable diseases are on the increase in Africa affecting younger populations frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 aims for 'healthy life and wellbeing for all at all ages', though there is a limited understanding of wellbeing particularly from patients' and families' perspectives in these populations. Palliative care is an approach which aims to improve the quality of life for patients and families affected by life-limiting disease, though access to palliative care has been described as an issue which is 'largely ignored' on the global health agenda. The aim of this Photovoice study was to explore patient and family perspectives of wellbeing and the contribution of palliative care following a diagnosis of advanced cancer in Blantyre, Malawi. METHODS: Between November 2016 and February 2017, 13 co-researchers (6 patients receiving palliative care for advanced cancer and 7 un-paid family caregivers) gathered photographs to depict aspects of their daily lives. Participatory analysis was conducted and an advocacy event (including photographic exhibits) held. RESULTS: Wellbeing was described as seeing improvements in the patients' function facilitating inclusion in activities of daily living (including income generation) that had not previously been possible due to their illness. Family caregivers, neighbours and community members play a key role as 'courage givers' supported by health workers and religious groups, though discrimination in the form of social exclusion was also reported to be significant with patients expressing that they may be considered 'prematurely dead' in their community. Palliative care improves wellbeing by providing pain and symptom management enabling patients and / or family caregivers to return to household and income generating tasks. Through close interaction with households and ongoing counselling palliative care services assist to reduce fear and discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: To achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3 for patients and families affected by life limiting illnesses in low resource settings, further understanding of the frequency and impact of discrimination is required as well as improved access to palliative care.},

  abstract = {The term latent tuberculosis (TB) was coined two centuries ago to describe post-mortem tuberculous pathology in the absence of ante-mortem tuberculosis manifestations. However, the meaning of the term has changed with each passing century, engendering confusion. In the early 20th century, with the advent of microbiological assays for live tubercle bacteria, latent TB switched from the host to refer to the bacteria from post-mortem tissues of nontuberculous hosts. Then in the late 20th century, the definition of latent TB infection returned to the host, this time referring to those with immunoreactivity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens. Based on this new definition, latent TB infection is unique among bacterial infectious diseases, in that supportive evidence of the infection state is sought by the absence of the causative bacterium and its clinical manifestations. The use of indirect bedside and laboratory tests to denote infection creates clinical and research confusion, as the tests for immunoreactivity suffer from recognized limitations in sensitivity and specificity. We propose that the concept of latent TB infection be separated from that of tuberculous immunoreactivity in the interest of correct diagnosis and focused treatment, correct formulation and interpretation of research questions and better allocation of programmatic resources for TB elimination. To this end, we suggest new terminology to course-correct our thinking about tuberculous infection (TBI) which is subdivided into tuberculous infection-no disease (TBInd) and the long-accepted term for the disease, tuberculosis (TB).},

This study was aimed to estimate the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. METHODS: Sixteen rural and urban villages were randomly selected in a stratified multistage cluster sampling. Individuals aged 15 years and older were screened by symptom inquiry for PTB. Those individuals who were symptomatic of PTB provided two sputum samples for smear microscopy, culture and molecular typing. RESULTS: The study covering 4,765 households screened a total of 12,175 individuals aged 15 years and above. The overall weighted prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed PTB in the Tigray region of Ethiopia was found to be 216/100,000 (95\% CI: 202.08, 230.76) while the weighted prevalence of smear-positive PTB was 169/100,000 (95\% CI: 155.53, 181.60). The prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB was higher amongst males (352/100 000; 95\% CI: 339.05, 364.52) than females (162/100 000; 95\% CI: 153.60, 171.17) and among rural (222/100,000; 95\% CI: 212.77-231.53) as compared to urban residents (193/100,000; 95\% CI: 183.39-203.59). CONCLUSIONS: This study found a relatively higher prevalence smear-positive PTB in the region than in a same period nationwide survey and identified a significant number of undetected PTB cases. The urgency for improved TB case detection and intensified community awareness is emphasized.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Whether HIV infection is associated with risk of death due to COVID-19 is unclear. We aimed to investigate this association in a large-scale population-based study in England. METHODS: We did a retrospective cohort study. Working on behalf of NHS England, we used the OpenSAFELY platform to analyse routinely collected electronic primary care data linked to national death registrations. We included all adults (aged ≥18 years) alive and in follow-up on Feb 1, 2020, and with at least 1 year of continuous registration with a general practitioner before this date. People with a primary care record for HIV infection were compared with people without HIV. The outcome was COVID-19 death, defined as the presence of International Classification of Diseases 10 codes U07.1 or U07.2 anywhere on the death certificate. Cox regression models were used to estimate the association between HIV infection and COVID-19 death; they were initially adjusted for age and sex, then we added adjustment for index of multiple deprivation and ethnicity, and then for a broad range of comorbidities. Interaction terms were added to assess effect modification by age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidities, and calendar time. RESULTS: 17\hphantom{,}282\hphantom{,}905 adults were included, of whom 27\hphantom{,}480 (0·16\%) had HIV recorded. People living with HIV were more likely to be male, of Black ethnicity, and from a more deprived geographical area than the general population. 14\hphantom{,}882 COVID-19 deaths occurred during the study period, with 25 among people with HIV. People living with HIV had higher risk of COVID-19 death than those without HIV after adjusting for age and sex: hazard ratio (HR) 2·90 (95\% CI 1·96-4·30; p{$<$}0·0001). The association was attenuated, but risk remained high, after adjustment for deprivation, ethnicity, smoking and obesity: adjusted HR 2·59 (95\% CI 1·74-3·84; p{$<$}0·0001). There was some evidence that the association was larger among people of Black ethnicity: HR 4·31 (95\% CI 2·42-7·65) versus 1·84 (1·03-3·26) in non-Black individuals (p-interaction=0·044). INTERPRETATION: People with HIV in the UK seem to be at increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. Targeted policies should be considered to address this raised risk as the pandemic response evolves.

Methods: A community-based cross-sectional tuberculosis (TB) disease prevalence survey was undertaken among adults aged {$>$}15 years in the tribal population of Madhya Pradesh. A multistage stratified cluster sampling was adopted. A representative random sample of villages predominated by tribal populations was selected from 11 districts. All eligible individuals were questioned for chest symptoms relating to TB. Sputum samples were collected from all eligible individuals, transported to the laboratory, and examined by Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear microscopy and solid media culture methods. Results: Of the 23 411 individuals eligible for screening, 22 270 (95.1\%) were screened for symptoms. The overall proportion of symptomatic individuals was 7.9\%. Overall prevalence (culture and/or smear positive) of PTB was 387 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 273-502] per 100 000 population. The prevalence increased with age and was also significantly higher among males (554/100 000; 95\% CI: 415-693) as compared with females (233/100 000; 95\% CI: 101-364) (P {$<$} 0.001). Conclusion: The findings suggest that the TB situation amongst the tribal population is not that different from the situation among the non-tribal population in the country. However, TB remains a major public health problem amongst the tribal population and there is a need to maintain and further strengthen TB control measures on a sustained and long-term basis.

We conducted a cross sectional survey for pulmonary TB and TB symptoms in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, in an urban cohort with known HIV prevalence. TB surveillance in the area is routinely based on passive case finding.Methods: Two cohorts were selected based on a previous HIV survey, but only 52.5\% of those enrolled in the adult cohort had participated in the HIV survey. One cohort included all adults living in 384 randomly selected houses; in this cohort 8\% (135/1687) were HIV infected. The other included individuals 50 years or older from all other houses in the study area; of these 11\% (62/571) were HIV infected. Symptom screening was done through household visits using a standardised questionnaire. TB suspects were investigated with sputum smear microscopy and X-ray.Results: In the adult cohort, we found 4 cases among 2989 individuals screened, giving a total TB prevalence of 134/100,000 (95\% CI 36-342/100,000). In the {$>$}50 years cohort, we found 4 cases among 571 individuals screened, giving a total prevalence of 701/100,000 (191-1784/100.000). Two of the eight detected TB cases were unknown by the TB program. Of the total TB cases five were HIV uninfected while three had unknown HIV status. The prevalence of TB symptoms was 2.1\% (63/2989) and 10.3\% (59/571) in the two cohorts respectively.Conclusions: In conclusion we found a moderately high prevalence of pulmonary TB and TB symptoms in the general population, higher among elderly individuals. By active case finding unknown cases were detected. Better awareness of TB and its symptoms needs to be promoted in low income settings. 2010 Bjerregaard-Andersen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background The Xpert MTB/RIF test (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) can detect tuberculosis and its multidrug-resistant form with very high sensitivity and specificity in controlled studies, but no performance data exist from district and subdistrict health facilities in tuberculosis-endemic countries. We aimed to assess operational feasibility, accuracy, and effectiveness of implementation in such settings. Methods We assessed adults (≥18 years) with suspected tuberculosis or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis consecutively presenting with cough lasting at least 2 weeks to urban health centres in South Africa, Peru, and India, drug-resistance screening facilities in Azerbaijan and the Philippines, and an emergency room in Uganda. Patients were excluded from the main analyses if their second sputum sample was collected more than 1 week after the first sample, or if no valid reference standard or MTB/RIF test was available. We compared one-off direct MTB/RIF testing in nine microscopy laboratories adjacent to study sites with 2–3 sputum smears and 1–3 cultures, dependent on site, and drug-susceptibility testing. We assessed indicators of robustness including indeterminate rate and between-site performance, and compared time to detection, reporting, and treatment, and patient dropouts for the techniques used. Findings We enrolled 6648 participants between Aug 11, 2009, and June 26, 2010. One-off MTB/RIF testing detected 933 (90·3\%) of 1033 culture-confirmed cases of tuberculosis, compared with 699 (67·1\%) of 1041 for microscopy. MTB/RIF test sensitivity was 76·9\% in smear-negative, culture-positive patients (296 of 385 samples), and 99·0\% specific (2846 of 2876 non-tuberculosis samples). MTB/RIF test sensitivity for rifampicin resistance was 94·4\% (236 of 250) and specificity was 98·3\% (796 of 810). Unlike microscopy, MTB/RIF test sensitivity was not significantly lower in patients with HIV co-infection. Median time to detection of tuberculosis for the MTB/RIF test was 0 days (IQR 0–1), compared with 1 day (0–1) for microscopy, 30 days (23–43) for solid culture, and 16 days (13–21) for liquid culture. Median time to detection of resistance was 20 days (10–26) for line-probe assay and 106 days (30–124) for conventional drug-susceptibility testing. Use of the MTB/RIF test reduced median time to treatment for smear-negative tuberculosis from 56 days (39–81) to 5 days (2–8). The indeterminate rate of MTB/RIF testing was 2·4\% (126 of 5321 samples) compared with 4·6\% (441 of 9690) for cultures. Interpretation The MTB/RIF test can effectively be used in low-resource settings to simplify patients' access to early and accurate diagnosis, thereby potentially decreasing morbidity associated with diagnostic delay, dropout and mistreatment.

This study aimed at determining factors associated with delayed PTB diagnosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. Methods. A retrospective observational study was done using clinic records of HIV-infected PTB suspects attending an HIV/AIDS clinic at Tintswalo rural hospital in South Africa (SA) between January 2006 and December 2007. Using routine clinic registers, 480 records were identified. Results. PTB diagnosis delay was found among 77/176 (43.8\%) of the patients diagnosed with PTB. The mean delay of PTB diagnosis was 170.6 days; diagnosis delay ranged 1-30 days in 27 (35.1\%) patients, 31-180 days in 24 (33.8\%) patients; 24 (31.2\%) patients remained undiagnosed for ≥180 days. Independent factors associated with delayed diagnosis were: older age {$>$}40 years (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.43, 95\% CI 1.45-8.08) and virological failure (OR 2.72, 95\% CI 1.09-6.74). Conclusion. There is a considerable delayed PTB diagnosis among HIV-infected patients in rural SA. Older patients as well as patients with high viral load are at a higher risk of PTB diagnosis delay. Therefore efforts to reduce PTB diagnosis delay need to emphasised.},

  abstract = {Traditional sample designs for household surveys are contingent upon the availability of a representative primary sampling frame. This is defined using enumeration units and population counts retrieved from decennial national censuses that can become rapidly inaccurate in highly dynamic demographic settings. To tackle the need for representative sampling frames, we propose an original grid-based sample design framework introducing essential concepts of spatial sampling in household surveys. In this framework, the sampling frame is defined based on gridded population estimates and formalized as a bi-dimensional random field, characterized by spatial trends, spatial autocorrelation, and stratification. The sampling design reflects the characteristics of the random field by combining contextual stratification and proportional to population size sampling. A nonparametric estimator is applied to evaluate the sampling design and inform sample size estimation. We demonstrate an application of the proposed framework through a case study developed in two provinces located in the western part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We define a sampling frame consisting of settled cells with associated population estimates. We then perform a contextual stratification by applying a principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering to a set of gridded geospatial covariates, and sample settled cells proportionally to population size. Lastly, we evaluate the sampling design by contrasting the empirical cumulative distribution function for the entire population of interest and its weighted counterpart across different sample sizes and identify an adequate sample size using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the two functions. The results of the case study underscore the strengths and limitations of the proposed grid-based sample design framework and foster further research into the application of spatial sampling concepts in household surveys.},

METHODS: Age- and sex-specific tuberculosis prevalence rates of smear-positive tuberculosis were obtained from tuberculosis prevalence surveys reported to the WHO or published in the literature. Age- and sex-specific notification rates from the same countries in 1996 were used. RESULTS: Prevalence data and notifications from 29 surveys in 14 countries were used. Notification rates varied strongly among countries, but the female/male ratio was below 1 and decreased with increasing age in almost all. The female/male (F/M) prevalence ratios were less than 0.5 in surveys in the South-East Asia and Western Pacific Region, and approximately 1 in the African Region. CONCLUSION: In most countries the F/M sex ratio in prevalent cases was similar or lower than that in notified cases, suggesting that F/M differences in notification rates may be largely due to epidemiological differences and not to differential access to health care. However, available data are limited as the prevalence surveys in Africa were carried out many years ago, and in Asia notification rates may be distorted by a large private sector with deficiencies in notification.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most tuberculosis-related deaths in people with HIV could be prevented with earlier diagnosis and treatment. The only commercially available tuberculosis point-of-care test (Alere Determine TB LAM Ag [AlereLAM]) has suboptimal sensitivity, which restricts its use in clinical practice. The novel Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) assay has been developed to improve the sensitivity of AlereLAM. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the FujiLAM assay for the detection of tuberculosis in hospital inpatients with HIV compared with the AlereLAM assay. METHODS: For this diagnostic accuracy study, we assessed biobanked urine samples obtained from the FIND Specimen Bank and the University of Cape Town Biobank, which had been collected from hospital inpatients (aged ≥18 years) with HIV during three independent prospective cohort studies done at two South African hospitals. Urine samples were tested using FujiLAM and AlereLAM assays. The conduct and reporting of each test was done blind to other test results. The primary objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FujiLAM compared with AlereLAM, against microbiological and composite reference standards (including clinical diagnoses). FINDINGS: Between April 18, 2018, and May 3, 2018, urine samples from 968 hospital inpatients with HIV were evaluated. The prevalence of microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis was 62\% and the median CD4 count was 86 cells per μL. Using the microbiological reference standard, the estimated sensitivity of FujiLAM was 70·4\% (95\% CI 53·0 to 83·1) compared with 42·3\% (31·7 to 51·8) for AlereLAM (difference 28·1\%) and the estimated specificity of FujiLAM was 90·8\% (86·0 to 94·4) and 95·0\% (87·7-98·8) for AlereLAM (difference -4·2\%). Against the composite reference standard, the specificity of both assays was higher (95·7\% [92·0 to 98·0] for FujiLAM vs 98·2\% [95·7 to 99·6] for AlereLAM; difference -2·5\%), but the sensitivity of both assays was lower (64·9\% [50·1 to 76·7] for FujiLAM vs 38·2\% [28·1 to 47·3] for AlereLAM; difference 26·7\%). INTERPRETATION: In comparison to AlereLAM, FujiLAM offers superior diagnostic sensitivity, while maintaining specificity, and could transform rapid point-of-care tuberculosis diagnosis for hospital inpatients with HIV. The applicability of FujiLAM for settings of intended use requires prospective assessment.

  abstract = {Background Excellent adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment is critical to cure TB and avoid the emergence of resistance. Wirelessly observed therapy (WOT) is a novel patient self-management system consisting of an edible ingestion sensor (IS), external wearable patch, and paired mobile device that can detect and digitally record medication ingestions. Our study determined the accuracy of ingestion detection in clinical and home settings using WOT and subsequently compared, in a randomized control trial (RCT), confirmed daily adherence to medication in persons using WOT or directly observed therapy (DOT) during TB treatment. Methods and findings We evaluated WOT in persons with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex disease using IS-enabled combination isoniazid 150 mg/rifampin 300 mg (IS-Rifamate). Seventy-seven participants with drug-susceptible TB in the continuation phase of treatment, prescribed daily isoniazid 300 mg and rifampin 600 mg, used IS-Rifamate. The primary endpoints of the trial were determination of the positive detection accuracy (PDA) of WOT, defined as the percentage of ingestions detected by WOT administered under direct observation, and subsequently the proportion of prescribed doses confirmed by WOT compared to DOT. Initially participants received DOT and WOT simultaneously for 2–3 weeks to allow calculation of WOT PDA, and the 95\% confidence interval (CI) was estimated using the bootstrap method with 10,000 samples. Sixty-one participants subsequently participated in an RCT to compare the proportion of prescribed doses confirmed by WOT and DOT. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive WOT or maximal in-person DOT. In the WOT arm, if ingestions were not remotely confirmed, the participant was contacted within 24 hours by text or cell phone to provide support. The number of doses confirmed was collected, and nonparametric methods were used for group and individual comparisons to estimate the proportions of confirmed doses in each randomized arm with 95\% CIs. Sensitivity analyses, not prespecified in the trial registration, were also performed, removing all nonworking (weekend and public holiday) and held-dose days. Participants, recruited from San Diego (SD) and Orange County (OC) Divisions of TB Control and Refugee Health, were 43.1 (range 18–80) years old, 57\% male, 42\% Asian, and 39\% white with 49\% Hispanic ethnicity. The PDA of WOT was 99.3\% (CI 98.1; 100). Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis within the RCT showed WOT confirmed 93\% versus 63\% DOT (p {$<$} 0.001) of daily doses prescribed. Secondary analysis removing all nonworking days (weekends and public holidays) and held doses from each arm showed WOT confirmed 95.6\% versus 92.7\% (p = 0.31); WOT was non-inferior to DOT (difference 2.8\% CI [−1.8\%, 9.1\%]). One hundred percent of participants preferred using WOT. WOT associated adverse events were {$<$}10\%, consisting of minor skin rash and pruritus associated with the patch. WOT provided longitudinal digital reporting in near real time, supporting patient self-management and allowing rapid remote identification of those who needed more support to maintain adherence. This study was conducted during the continuation phase of TB treatment, limiting its generalizability to the entire TB treatment course. Conclusions In terms of accuracy, WOT was equivalent to DOT. WOT was superior to DOT in supporting confirmed daily adherence to TB medications during the continuation phase of TB treatment and was overwhelmingly preferred by participants. WOT should be tested in high-burden TB settings, where it may substantially support low- and middle-income country (LMIC) TB programs. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01960257.},

We included studies published in English between Jan 1, 1980, and April 13, 2020. Studies of active case-finding in the general population, in populations perceived to be at high risk for tuberculosis, and in closed settings were included, whereas studies of tuberculosis screening at health-care facilities, among household contacts, or among children only, and studies that screened fewer than 1000 people were excluded.

  abstract = {Background People living with HIV (PLHIV) have a high risk of death if hospitalised in low-income countries. Tuberculosis has long been the leading cause of admission and death, in part due to suboptimal diagnostics. Two promising new diagnostic tools are digital chest Xray with computer-aided diagnosis (DCXR-CAD) and urine testing with Fujifilm SILVAMP LAM (FujiLAM). Neither test has been rigorously evaluated among inpatients. Test characteristics may be complementary, with FujiLAM especially sensitive for disseminated tuberculosis and DCXR-CAD especially sensitive for pulmonary tuberculosis, making combined interventions of interest. Design and methods An exploratory unblinded, single site, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial, with day of admission as the unit of randomisation. A third, smaller, integrated cohort arm (4:4:1 random allocation) contributes to understanding case-mix, but not trial outcomes. Participants are adults living with HIV not currently on TB treatment. The intervention (DCXR-CAD plus urine FujiLAM plus usual care) is compared to usual care alone. The primary outcome is proportion of participants started on tuberculosis treatment by day 56, with secondary outcomes of mortality (time to event) measured to to 56 days from enrolment, proportions with undiagnosed tuberculosis at death or hospital discharge and comparing proportions with enrolment-day tuberculosis treatment initiation. Discussion Both DCXR-CAD and FujiLAM have potential clinical utility and may have complementary diagnostic performance. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial to evaluate these tests among hospitalised PLHIV.},

DESIGN: Population cohort study using an existing electronic health information system ('SPINE') at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital and Blantyre census data. METHODS: We used multiple imputation and negative binomial regression to estimate population age- and sex-specific admission rates over time. We used a log-binomial model to investigate trends in risk of in-hospital death. RESULTS: Of 32,814 adult medical admissions during Q4.2012-Q3.2019, HIV status was recorded for 75.6\%. HIV-positive admissions decreased substantially between 2012 and 2019. After imputation for missing data, HIV positive admissions were highest in Q3.2013 (173 per 100,000 adult Blantyre residents) and lowest in Q3.2019 (53 per 100,000 residents). An estimated 10,818 fewer than expected people living with HIV (PLHIV) (95\%CI 10,068-11,568) were admitted during 2012-2019 compared to the counterfactual situation where admission rates stayed the same throughout this period.

In-hospital mortality for PLHIV was 23.5\%, with no significant change over time in any age-sex group, and no association with ART use at admission. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of admission for adult PLHIV decreased substantially, likely due to large increases in community provision of HIV diagnosis, treatment and care. However, HIV-positive in-hospital deaths remain unacceptably high, despite improvements in ART coverage. A concerted research and implementation agenda is urgently needed to reduce inpatient deaths among PLHIV.},

  abstract = {Objectives Tuberculosis symptoms are very common among people living with HIV (PLHIV) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), are not specific for tuberculosis disease and may result in delayed ART start. The risks and benefits of same-day ART initiation in PLHIV with tuberculosis symptoms are unknown. Methods We systematically reviewed nine databases on 12 March 2020 to identify studies that investigated same-day ART initiation among PLHIV with tuberculosis symptoms and reported both their approach to TB screening and clinical outcomes. We extracted and summarized data about TB screening, numbers of people starting same-day ART and outcomes. Results We included four studies. Two studies deferred ART for everyone with any tuberculosis symptoms (one or more of cough, fever, night sweats or weight loss) and substantial numbers of people had deferred ART start (28\% and 39\% did not start same-day ART). Two studies permitted some people with tuberculosis symptoms to start same-day ART, and fewer people deferred ART (2\% and 16\% did not start same-day). Two of the four studies were conducted sequentially; proven viral load suppression at 8 months was 31\% when everyone with tuberculosis symptoms had ART deferred, and 44\% when the algorithm was changed so that some people with tuberculosis symptoms could start same-day ART. Conclusions Although tuberculosis symptoms are very common in people starting ART, there is insufficient evidence about whether presence of tuberculosis symptoms should lead to ART start being deferred or not.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV and tuberculosis are frequently diagnosed concurrently. In March 2021, World Health Organization recommended that antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started within two weeks of tuberculosis treatment start, at any CD4 count. We assessed whether earlier ART improved outcomes in people with newly diagnosed HIV and tuberculosis. METHODS: We did a systematic review by searching nine databases for trials that compared earlier ART to later ART initiation in people with HIV and tuberculosis. We included studies published from database inception to 12 March 2021. We compared ART within four weeks versus ART more than four weeks after TB treatment, and ART within two weeks versus ART between two and eight weeks, and stratified analysis by CD4 count. The main outcome was death; secondary outcomes included IRIS and AIDS-defining events. We pooled effect estimates using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We screened 2468 abstracts, and identified nine trials. Among people with all CD4 counts, there was no difference in mortality by earlier ART (≤4~week) versus later ART ({$>$}4~week) (risk difference [RD] 0\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -2\% to +1\%). Among people with CD4 count ≤50~cells/mm3 , earlier ART (≤4~weeks) reduced risk of death (RD -6\%, -10\% to -1\%). Among people with all CD4 counts earlier ART (≤4~weeks) increased the risk of IRIS (RD +6\%, 95\% CI +2\% to +10\%) and reduced the incidence of AIDS-defining events (RD -2\%, 95\% CI -4\% to 0\%). Results were similar when trials were restricted to the four trials which permitted comparison of ART within two weeks to ART between two and eight weeks. Trials were conducted between 2004 and 2014, before recommendations to treat HIV at any CD4 count or to rapidly start ART in people without TB. No trials included children or pregnant women. No trials included integrase inhibitors in ART regimens. DISCUSSION: Earlier ART did not alter risk of death overall among people living with HIV who had TB disease. For logistical and patient preference reasons, earlier ART initiation for everyone with TB and HIV may be preferred to later ART.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two weeks' isolation is widely recommended for people commencing treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The evidence that this corresponds to clearance of potentially infectious tuberculous mycobacteria in sputum is not well established. This World Health Organization-commissioned review investigated sputum sterilisation dynamics during TB treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: For the main analysis, 2 systematic literature searches of OvidSP MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus were conducted to identify studies with data on TB infectiousness (all studies to search date, 1 December 2017) and all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for drug-susceptible TB (from 1 January 1990 to search date, 20 February 2018). Included articles reported on patients receiving effective treatment for culture-confirmed drug-susceptible pulmonary TB. The outcome of interest was sputum bacteriological conversion: the proportion of patients having converted by a defined time point or a summary measure of time to conversion, assessed by smear or culture. Any study design where more than 10 participants were included was considered. Record sifting and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Random effects meta-analyses were performed. A narrative summary additionally describes the results of a systematic search for data evaluating infectiousness from humans to experimental animals (PubMed, all studies to 27 March 2018). Other evidence on duration of infectiousness-including studies reporting on cough dynamics, human tuberculin skin test conversion, or early bactericidal activity of TB treatments-was outside the scope of this review. The literature search was repeated on 22 November 2020, at the request of the editors, to identify studies published after the previous censor date. Four small studies reporting 3 different outcome measures were identified, which included no data that would alter the findings of the review; they are not included in the meta-analyses. Of 5,290 identified records, 44 were included. Twenty-seven (61\%) were RCTs and 17 (39\%) were cohort studies. Thirteen studies (30\%) reported data from Africa, 12 (27\%) from Asia, 6 (14\%) from South America, 5 (11\%) from North America, and 4 (9\%) from Europe. Four studies reported data from multiple continents. Summary estimates suggested smear conversion in 9\% of patients at 2 weeks (95\% CI 3\%-24\%, 1 single study [N = 1]), and 82\% of patients at 2 months of treatment (95\% CI 78\%-86\%, N = 10). Among baseline smear-positive patients, solid culture conversion occurred by 2 weeks in 5\% (95\% CI 0\%-14\%, N = 2), increasing to 88\% at 2 months (95\% CI 84\%-92\%, N = 20). At equivalent time points, liquid culture conversion was achieved in 3\% (95\% CI 1\%-16\%, N = 1) and 59\% (95\% CI 47\%-70\%, N = 8). Significant heterogeneity was observed. Further interrogation of the data to explain this heterogeneity was limited by the lack of disaggregation of results, including by factors such as HIV status, baseline smear status, and the presence or absence of lung cavitation. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found that most patients remained culture positive at 2 weeks of TB treatment, challenging the view that individuals are not infectious after this interval. Culture positivity is, however, only 1 component of infectiousness, with reduced cough frequency and aerosol generation after TB treatment initiation likely to also be important. Studies that integrate our findings with data on cough dynamics could provide a more complete perspective on potential transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by individuals on treatment.

  abstract = {Insulin resistance (IR) precedes the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and increases cardiovascular disease risk. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered new loci associated with T2D, their contribution to explain the mechanisms leading to decreased insulin sensitivity has been very limited. Thus, new approaches are necessary to explore the genetic architecture of insulin resistance. To that end, we generated an iPSC library across the spectrum of insulin sensitivity in humans. RNA-seq based analysis of 310 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones derived from 100 individuals allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes between insulin resistant and sensitive iPSC lines. Analysis of the co-expression architecture uncovered several insulin sensitivity-relevant gene sub-networks, and predictive network modeling identified a set of key driver genes that regulate these co-expression modules. Functional validation in human adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells (SKMCs) confirmed the relevance of the key driver candidate genes for insulin responsiveness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective strategies are needed to facilitate the prompt diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in countries with a high burden of the disease. METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in which Ugandan community health centers were assigned to a multicomponent diagnostic strategy (on-site molecular testing for tuberculosis, guided restructuring of clinic workflows, and monthly feedback of quality metrics) or routine care (on-site sputum-smear microscopy and referral-based molecular testing). The primary outcome was the number of adults treated for confirmed tuberculosis within 14 days after presenting to the health center for evaluation during the 16-month intervention period. Secondary outcomes included completion of tuberculosis testing, same-day diagnosis, and same-day treatment. Outcomes were also assessed on the basis of proportions. RESULTS: A total of 20 health centers underwent randomization, with 10 assigned to each group. Of 10,644 eligible adults (median age, 40 years) whose data were evaluated, 60.1\% were women and 43.8\% had human immunodeficiency virus infection. The intervention strategy led to a greater number of patients being treated for confirmed tuberculosis within 14 days after presentation (342 patients across 10 intervention health centers vs. 220 across 10 control health centers; adjusted rate ratio, 1.56; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 2.01). More patients at intervention centers than at control centers completed tuberculosis testing (adjusted rate ratio, 1.85; 95\% CI, 1.21 to 2.82), received a same-day diagnosis (adjusted rate ratio, 1.89; 95\% CI, 1.39 to 2.56), and received same-day treatment for confirmed tuberculosis (adjusted rate ratio, 2.38; 95\% CI, 1.57 to 3.61). Among 706 patients with confirmed tuberculosis, a higher proportion in the intervention group than in the control group were treated on the same day (adjusted rate ratio, 2.29; 95\% CI, 1.23 to 4.25) or within 14 days after presentation (adjusted rate ratio, 1.22; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 1.40). CONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent diagnostic strategy that included on-site molecular testing plus implementation supports to address barriers to delivery of high-quality tuberculosis evaluation services led to greater numbers of patients being tested, receiving a diagnosis, and being treated for confirmed tuberculosis.

DESIGN: Cluster-randomized trial in eight urban neighborhoods pair-matched by TB incidence and randomly assigned to receive either the DOTS-A or DOTS strategy. DOTS-A added intensive screening of household contacts of active TB cases and provision of treatment to secondary cases and preventive therapy to contacts with latent TB infection (LTBI) to the standard DOTS strategy. The primary endpoint was the TB incidence rates in communities after 5 years of intervention. RESULTS: From November 2000 to December 2004, respectively 339 and 311 pulmonary TB cases were enrolled and 1003 and 960 household were identified in DOTS and DOTS-A communities. Among contacts from DOTS-A communities, 26 (4\%) had active TB diagnosed and treated, 429 (61.3\%) had LTBI detected and 258 (60.1\%) started preventive therapy. TB incidence increased by 5\% in DOTS communities and decreased by 10\% in DOTS-A communities, for a difference of 15\% after 5 years (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: DOTS-A was associated with a modest reduction in TB incidence and may be an important strategy for reducing the burden of TB.},

METHODS: Survey was conducted among persons {$>$}/= 15 years of age in fifteen clusters selected by simple random sampling; each consisting of 5-12 villages. Persons having symptoms suggestive of PTB or history of anti-TB treatment (ATT) were eligible for sputum examination by smear microscopy for Acid Fast Bacilli and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis; two sputum samples were collected from each eligible person. Persons with one or both sputum specimen positive on microscopy and/or culture were labeled suffering from PTB. Prevalence was estimated after imputing missing values to correct for bias introduced by incompleteness of data. In six clusters, registered persons were also screened by X-ray chest. Persons with any abnormal shadow on X-ray were eligible for sputum examination in addition to those with symptoms and ATT. Multiplication factor calculated as ratio of prevalence while using both screening tools to prevalence using symptoms screening alone was applied to entire study population to estimate prevalence corrected for non-screening by X-ray. RESULTS: Of 71,874 residents {$>$}/= 15 years of age, 63,362 (88.2\%) were screened for symptoms and ATT. Of them, 5120 (8.1\%) - 4681 (7.4\%) with symptoms and an additional 439 (0.7\%) with ATT were eligible for sputum examination. Spot specimen were collected from 4850 (94.7\%) and early morning sputum specimens from 4719 (92.2\%). Using symptom screening alone, prevalence of smear, culture and bacteriologically positive PTB in persons {$>$}/= 15 years of age was 83 (CI: 57-109), 152 (CI: 108-197) and 196 (CI :145-246) per 100,000 population respectively. Prevalence corrected for non-screening by X-ray was 108 (CI: 82-134), 198 (CI: 153-243) and 254 (CI: 204-301) respectively.

We calculated crude NNS for Xpert- or culture-confirmed TB and weighted mean NNS stratified by screening approach, population/risk group, and country TB burden.RESULTS: Of the 27,221 abstracts screened, we identified 58 studies eligible for inclusion, including 5 in low/moderate TB incidence settings and 53 in medium/high incidence settings. Populations screened for TB included inpatients, outpatients not receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), outpatients receiving ART, those with CD4 {$<$} 200 cells/µL, children aged ≤15 years, pregnant PLWH, and PLWH in prisons. Screening tools included symptom-based screening, chest X-ray, C-reactive protein levels, and Xpert. The weighted mean NNS varied across groups but was consistently low, ranging from 4 among inpatients in moderate/high TB burden settings to 137 among pregnant PLWH in moderate/high TB burden settings.CONCLUSIONS: ACF is a high yield intervention among PLWH. Approaches to screening should be tailored to local epidemiological and health-system contexts, and sensitive screening tools such as Xpert should be implemented where feasible.},

  abstract = {SETTING: Mass miniature radiography (MMR) is the usual tool for population screening in tuberculosis case prevalence surveys. However, this facility is not available at most centres in India. OBJECTIVE: The feasibility of conducting a survey without MMR screening was therefore investigated. DESIGN: The study was carried out in Bangalore rural district during 1984-1986. The area was the same as for six earlier prevalence surveys conducted since 1961. The population aged up to 44 years was tuberculin tested. Persons with test induration size of {$>$} or = 10 mm were eligible for sputum examination, besides all those aged over 45 years who were eligible without discrimination. RESULTS: Reduction of workload was not adequately achieved through screening, as 78.4\% of the registered population (29,400) was still eligible for sputum examination. The changed screening procedure in this survey also made comparison with earlier data difficult. In spite of more liberal and comprehensive screening, the observed prevalence rate of cases (438/100,000 population aged 10+ years) was similar to earlier surveys. The prevalence rate of smear-positive cases, however, was much lower (68/100,000 population aged 10+ years). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the candidate screening procedure was not suitable. The findings nevertheless conformed to the overall declining trend for the area, as reported earlier.},

  abstract = {Background               : In low-income countries, like Malawi, important public health measures including social distancing or a lockdown have been challenging to implement owing to socioeconomic constraints, leading to predictions that the COVID-19 pandemic would progress rapidly. However, due to limited capacity to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are no reliable estimates of the true burden of infection and death. ~We, therefore, conducted a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey amongst health care workers (HCWs) in Blantyre city to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban Malawi.                                         Methods               : We recruited 500 otherwise asymptomatic HCWs from Blantyre City (Malawi) from 22               nd               May 2020 to 19               th               June 2020 and serum samples were collected from all participants. A commercial ELISA was used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum.                                         Results               : A total of 84 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The HCWs with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody results came from different parts of the city. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 12.3\% [CI 8.2 - 16.5]. Using age-stratified infection fatality estimates reported from elsewhere, we found that at the observed adjusted seroprevalence, the number of predicted deaths was eight times the number of reported deaths.                                         Conclusions               : The high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs and the discrepancy in the predicted versus reported deaths suggests that there was early exposure but slow progression of COVID-19 epidemic in urban Malawi. This highlights the urgent need for development of locally parameterised mathematical models to more accurately predict the trajectory of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa for better evidence-based policy decisions and public health response planning.},

Objective To determine whether health care worker (HCW) practice in investigating people with TB symptoms was altered when the initial test for TB was changed from smear microscopy to Xpert MTB/RIF. Design Cross-sectional substudy at clinics participating in a pragmatic cluster randomised trial, Xpert for TB: Evaluating a New Diagnostic "XTEND", which evaluated the effect of Xpert MTB/RIF implementation in South Africa. Methods Consecutive adults exiting PHCs reporting at least one TB symptom (defined as any of cough, weight loss, night sweats and fever) were enrolled. The main outcome was the proportion who self-reported having sputum requested by HCW during the clinic encounter just completed. Results 3604 adults exiting PHCs (1676 in Xpert arm, 1928 in microscopy arm) were enrolled (median age 38 years, 71.4\% female, 38.8\% reported being HIV-positive, 70\% reported cough). For 1267 participants (35.2\%) the main reason for attending the clinic was TB symptom(s)., Overall 2130/3604 (59.1\%) said they reported their symptom(s) to HCW. 22.7\% (818/3604) reported having been asked to give sputum for TB investigation. Though participants in the Xpert vs. microscopy arm were more likely to have sputum requested by HCW, this was not significantly different: overall (26.0\% [436/1676] vs 19.8\% [382/1928]; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.31, [95\% CI 0.78–2.20]) and when restricted to those presenting at clinics due to symptoms (49.1\% [260/530] vs 29.9\% [220/737]; aPR 1.38 [0.89–2.13]) and those reporting being HIV-positive (29.4\% [190/647] vs 20.8\% [156/749]; aPR 1.38[0.88–2.16])., Those attending clinic due to TB symptoms, were more likely to have sputum requested if they had increasing number of symptoms; longer duration of cough, unintentional weight loss and night sweats and if they reported symptoms to HCW. Conclusions A large proportion of people exiting PHCs reporting TB symptoms did not get tested. Implementation of Xpert MTB/RIF did not substantially change the probability of testing for TB. Better systems are needed to ensure that opportunities to identify active TB among PHC attendees are not missed.},

The study aimed to determine a reliable molecular diagnostic test for               Salmonella               in stool specimens.                                         Methods:               We optimized an in-house monoplex real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of               Salmonella               TTR               and               InvA               genes in stool by including a selenite broth pre-culture step for               Salmonella               before DNA extraction, and validated their specificity against other local common pathogens. Then we assessed their performance ~against a well-validated multiplex PCR targeting the same               TTR               and               InvA               genes, and against stool culture using clinical stool specimens collected from a cohort of 50 asymptomatic healthy Malawian children that were sampled at 1-month intervals over a period of 12 months. We employed a latent Markov model to estimate the specificities and sensitivities of PCR methods.                                         Results               : TTR and InvA primers were both able to detect all the different               Salmonella               serovars tested, and had superior limits of detection if DNA was extracted after selenite pre-culture. TTR sensitivity and specificity for monoplex-PCR were (99.53\%, 95.46\%) and for multiplex-PCR (90.30\%, 99.30\%) respectively. InvA specificity and specificity for using monoplex-PCR was (95.06\%, 90.31\%) and multiplex-PCRs (89.41\%, 98.00\%) respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for standard stool culture were 62.88\% and 99.99\% respectively. Culture showed the highest PPV (99.73\%) and mono-TTR had the highest NPV (99.67\%).                                         Conclusion:               Test methods demonstrated high concordance although stool culture and monoplexed TTR primers had superior specificity and sensitivity respectively. The use of selenite pre-enrichment step increased               Salmonella               detection rate. Taken together, molecular detection methods used here could be used to reveal the true extent of both asymptomatic and symptomatic               Salmonella               exposure events.},

  abstract = {Background Conventional HIV testing services have been less comprehensive in reaching men than in reaching women globally, but HIV self-testing (HIVST) appears to be an acceptable alternative. Measurement of linkage to post-test services following HIVST remains the biggest challenge, yet is the biggest driver of cost-effectiveness. We investigated the impact of HIVST alone or with additional interventions on the uptake of testing and linkage to care or prevention among male partners of antenatal care clinic attendees in a novel adaptive trial. Methods and findings An adaptive multi-arm, 2-stage cluster randomised trial was conducted between 8 August 2016 and 30 June 2017, with antenatal care clinic (ANC) days (i.e., clusters of women attending on a single day) as the unit of randomisation. Recruitment was from Ndirande, Bangwe, and Zingwangwa primary health clinics in urban Blantyre, Malawi. Women attending an ANC for the first time for their current pregnancy (regardless of trimester), 18 years and older, with a primary male partner not known to be on ART were enrolled in the trial after giving consent. Randomisation was to either the standard of care (SOC; with a clinic invitation letter to the male partner) or 1 of 5 intervention arms: the first arm provided women with 2 HIVST kits for their partners; the second and third arms provided 2 HIVST kits along with a conditional fixed financial incentive of \$3 or \$10; the fourth arm provided 2 HIVST kits and a 10\% chance of receiving \$30 in a lottery; and the fifth arm provided 2 HIVST kits and a phone call reminder for the women’s partners. The primary outcome was the proportion of male partners who were reported to have tested for HIV and linked into care or prevention within 28 days, with referral for antiretroviral therapy (ART) or circumcision accordingly. Women were interviewed at 28 days about partner testing and adverse events. Cluster-level summaries compared each intervention versus SOC using eligible women as the denominator (intention-to-treat). Risk ratios were adjusted for male partner testing history and recruitment clinic. A total of 2,349/3,137 (74.9\%) women participated (71 ANC days), with a mean age of 24.8 years (SD: 5.4). The majority (2,201/2,233; 98.6\%) of women were married, 254/2,107 (12.3\%) were unable to read and write, and 1,505/2,247 (67.0\%) were not employed. The mean age for male partners was 29.6 years (SD: 7.5), only 88/2,200 (4.0\%) were unemployed, and 966/2,210 (43.7\%) had never tested for HIV before. Women in the SOC arm reported that 17.4\% (71/408) of their partners tested for HIV, whereas a much higher proportion of partners were reported to have tested for HIV in all intervention arms (87.0\%–95.4\%, p {$<$} 0.001 in all 5 intervention arms). As compared with those who tested in the SOC arm (geometric mean 13.0\%), higher proportions of partners met the primary endpoint in the HIVST + \$3 (geometric mean 40.9\%, adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 3.01 [95\% CI 1.63–5.57], p {$<$} 0.001), HIVST + \$10 (51.7\%, aRR 3.72 [95\% CI 1.85–7.48], p {$<$} 0.001), and phone reminder (22.3\%, aRR 1.58 [95\% CI 1.07–2.33], p = 0.021) arms. In contrast, there was no significant increase in partners meeting the primary endpoint in the HIVST alone (geometric mean 17.5\%, aRR 1.45 [95\% CI 0.99–2.13], p = 0.130) or lottery (18.6\%, aRR 1.43 [95\% CI 0.96–2.13], p = 0.211) arms. The lottery arm was dropped at interim analysis. Overall, 46 male partners were confirmed to be HIV positive, 42 (91.3\%) of whom initiated ART within 28 days; 222 tested HIV negative and were not already circumcised, of whom 135 (60.8\%) were circumcised as part of the trial. No serious adverse events were reported. Costs per male partner who attended the clinic with a confirmed HIV test result were \$23.73 and \$28.08 for the HIVST + \$3 and HIVST + \$10 arms, respectively. Notable limitations of the trial included the relatively small number of clusters randomised to each arm, proxy reporting of the male partner testing outcome, and being unable to evaluate retention in care. Conclusions In this study, the odds of men’s linkage to care or prevention increased substantially using conditional fixed financial incentives plus partner-delivered HIVST; combinations were potentially affordable.

DESIGN: A quality assurance study of OraQuick (OraSure), Determine HIV 1/2™ (Alere) and Uni-Gold™ (Recombigen®). METHODS: Consecutive adults (≥18y) attending Ndirande Health Centre in urban Blantyre, Malawi in January to April 2012 underwent HIV testing with two of each of the three rapid diagnostic test kits stored for 28 days at either 18°C (optimally-stored) or at 37°C (pre-incubated). Used OraQuick test kits were stored in a laboratory for delayed day 1 and subsequent monthly re-reading was undertaken for one year. RESULTS: Of 378 individuals who underwent parallel testing, 5 (1.3\%) were dropped from the final analysis due to discordant or missing reference standard results (optimally-stored Determine and Uni-Gold). Compared to the diagnostic reference standard, OraQuick had a sensitivity of 97.2\% (95\% CI: 93.6-99.6). There were 7 false negative results among all test kits stored at 37°C and three false negatives among optimally stored kits. Excellent agreement between pre-incubated tests and optimally-stored tests with Kappa values of 1.00 for Determine and Uni-Gold; and 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.95; 1.00) for OraQuick were observed. There was high visual stability on re-reading of OraQuick, with only 1/375 pre-incubated and 1/371 optimally-stored OraQuick kits changing from the initial result over 12 months. CONCLUSION: Erroneous results observed during HIV testing in low income settings are likely to be due to factors other than suboptimal storage conditions. Re-reading returned OraQuick kits may offer a convenient and accurate quality assurance approach, including in HIV self-testing programmes.},

We aimed to investigate whether secondary administration of HIVST kits, with or without an additional financial incentive, via women receiving antenatal care (ANC) or via people newly diagnosed with HIV (ie, index patients) could improve the proportion of male partners tested or the number of people newly diagnosed with HIV.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We did a three-arm, open-label, pragmatic, cluster-randomised trial of 27 health centres (clusters), eligible if they were a government primary health centre providing ANC, HIV testing, and ART services, across four districts of Malawi. We recruited women (aged ≥18 years) attending their first ANC visit and whose male partner was available, not already taking ART, and not already tested for HIV during this pregnancy (ANC cohort), and people (aged ≥18 years) with newly diagnosed HIV during routine clinic HIV testing who had at least one sexual contact not already known to be HIV-positive (index cohort). Centres were randomly assigned (1:1:1), using a public selection of computer-generated random allocations, to enhanced standard of care (including an invitation for partners to attend HIV testing services), HIVST only, or HIVST plus a US\$10 financial incentive for retesting. The primary outcome for the ANC cohort was the proportion of male partners reportedly tested, as ascertained by interview with women in this cohort at day 28.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The EQ-5D is a standardised instrument that measures health-related quality-of-life and explores cost-effectiveness of treatments. Malawi is a low-resource country that would benefit from assessment of quality-of-life among individuals living with chronic conditions. Chichewa is the official native language of Malawi. The Chichewa version of the EQ-5D-3L developed by EuroQoL group has not been validated with Chichewa speakers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinimetric properties of the Chichewa EQ-5D-3L. METHODS: Patients with orthopaedic conditions were recruited in the outpatient orthopaedic clinics and wards at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi. Fifty-three patients with various musculoskeletal problems were administered the Chichewa EQ-5D-3L and World Health Organization quality of life (WHO-QOL) questionnaires. To assess repeatability, a separate test-retest population of 20 patients were also selected from orthopaedic clinics and wards to fill out the questionnaire twice. RESULTS: Convergence validity was determined, with each of the WHO-QOL domains and the EQ-5D descriptive index and visual analogue scale (VAS) having good to moderate correlation (r = 0.3-0.7). Internal consistency was measured for the descriptive index, and the Cronbach's alpha was 0.7. The ceiling effect for the descriptive index and the VAS were 9.4\% and 0\%, respectively. No respondents reached floor effect for the descriptive index or the VAS. The test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient reliability at 14 days was 0.984 for the VAS and 1 for the descriptive index, with all 20 respondents providing the same responses. CONCLUSIONS: The EuroQoL translated version of the Chichewa EQ-5D-3L was found to demonstrate adequate validity, internal consistency, floor/ceiling effects, and reliability.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although HIV testing and counseling (HTC) uptake has increased dramatically in Africa, facility-based services are unlikely to ever meet ongoing need to the full. A major constraint in scaling up community and home-based HTC services is the unacceptability of receiving HTC from a provider known personally to prospective clients. We investigated the potential of supervised oral HIV self-testing from this perspective. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult members of 60 households and 72 members of community peer groups in urban Blantyre, Malawi, were selected using population-weighted random cluster sampling. Participants were offered self-testing plus confirmatory HTC (parallel testing with two rapid finger-prick blood tests), standard HTC alone, or no testing. 283 (95.6\%) of 298 selected adults participated, including 136 (48.0\%) men. 175 (61.8\%) had previously tested (19 known HIV positive), although only 64 (21.5\%) within the last year. HIV prevalence was 18.5\%. Among 260 (91.9\%) who opted to self-test after brief demonstration and illustrated instructions, accuracy was 99.2\% (two false negatives). Although 98.5\% rated the test "not hard at all to do," 10.0\% made minor procedural errors, and 10.0\% required extra help. Most participants indicated willingness to accept self-test kits, but not HTC, from a neighbor (acceptability 94.5\% versus 46.8\%, p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral supervised self-testing was highly acceptable and accurate, although minor errors and need for supervisory support were common. This novel option has potential for high uptake at local community level if it can be supervised and safely linked to counseling and care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC) achieves high uptake, but is difficult and expensive to implement and sustain. We investigated a novel alternative based on HIV self-testing (HIVST). The aim was to evaluate the uptake of testing, accuracy, linkage into care, and health outcomes when highly convenient and flexible but supported access to HIVST kits was provided to a well-defined and closely monitored population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following enumeration of 14 neighbourhoods in urban Blantyre, Malawi, trained resident volunteer-counsellors offered oral HIVST kits (OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test) to adult (≥16 y old) residents (n = 16,660) and reported community events, with all deaths investigated by verbal autopsy. Written and demonstrated instructions, pre- and post-test counselling, and facilitated HIV care assessment were provided, with a request to return kits and a self-completed questionnaire. Accuracy, residency, and a study-imposed requirement to limit HIVST to one test per year were monitored by home visits in a systematic quality assurance (QA) sample. Overall, 14,004 (crude uptake 83.8\%, revised to 76.5\% to account for population turnover) residents self-tested during months 1-12, with adolescents (16-19 y) most likely to test. 10,614/14,004 (75.8\%) participants shared results with volunteer-counsellors. Of 1,257 (11.8\%) HIV-positive participants, 26.0\% were already on antiretroviral therapy, and 524 (linkage 56.3\%) newly accessed care with a median CD4 count of 250 cells/μl (interquartile range 159-426). HIVST uptake in months 13-24 was more rapid (70.9\% uptake by 6 mo), with fewer (7.3\%, 95\% CI 6.8\%-7.8\%) positive participants. Being "forced to test", usually by a main partner, was reported by 2.9\% (95\% CI 2.6\%-3.2\%) of 10,017 questionnaire respondents in months 1-12, but satisfaction with HIVST (94.4\%) remained high. No HIVST-related partner violence or suicides were reported. HIVST and repeat HTC results agreed in 1,639/1,649 systematically selected (1 in 20) QA participants (99.4\%), giving a sensitivity of 93.6\% (95\% CI 88.2\%-97.0\%) and a specificity of 99.9\% (95\% CI 99.6\%-100\%). Key limitations included use of aggregate data to report uptake of HIVST and being unable to adjust for population turnover. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based HIVST achieved high coverage in two successive years and was safe, accurate, and acceptable. Proactive HIVST strategies, supported and monitored by communities, could substantially complement existing approaches to providing early HIV diagnosis and periodic repeat testing to adolescents and adults in high-HIV settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active case finding (ACF) may be valuable in tuberculosis (TB) control, but questions remain about its optimum implementation in different settings. For example, smear microscopy misses up to half of TB cases, yet is cheap and detects the most infectious TB cases. What, then, is the incremental value of using more sensitive and specific, yet more costly, tests such as Xpert MTB/RIF in ACF in a high-burden setting? METHODS AND FINDINGS: We constructed a dynamic transmission model of TB, calibrated to be consistent with an urban slum population in India. We applied this model to compare the potential cost and impact of 2 hypothetical approaches following initial symptom screening: (i) 'moderate accuracy' testing employing a microscopy-like test (i.e., lower cost but also lower accuracy) for bacteriological confirmation and (ii) 'high accuracy' testing employing an Xpert-like test (higher cost but also higher accuracy, while also detecting rifampicin resistance). Results suggest that ACF using a moderate-accuracy test could in fact cost more overall than using a high-accuracy test. Under an illustrative budget of US\$20 million in a slum population of 2 million, high-accuracy testing would avert 1.14 (95\% credible interval 0.75-1.99, with p = 0.28) cases relative to each case averted by moderate-accuracy testing. Test specificity is a key driver: High-accuracy testing would be significantly more impactful at the 5\% significance level, as long as the high-accuracy test has specificity at least 3 percentage points greater than the moderate-accuracy test. Additional factors promoting the impact of high-accuracy testing are that (i) its ability to detect rifampicin resistance can lead to long-term cost savings in second-line treatment and (ii) its higher sensitivity contributes to the overall cases averted by ACF. Amongst the limitations of this study, our cost model has a narrow focus on the commodity costs of testing and treatment; our estimates should not be taken as indicative of the overall cost of ACF. There remains uncertainty about the true specificity of tests such as smear and Xpert-like tests in ACF, relating to the accuracy of the reference standard under such conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cheaper diagnostics do not necessarily translate to less costly ACF, as any savings from the test cost can be strongly outweighed by factors including false-positive TB treatment, reduced sensitivity, and foregone savings in second-line treatment. In resource-limited settings, it is therefore important to take all of these factors into account when designing cost-effective strategies for ACF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In South Africa the estimated incidence of all forms of tuberculosis (TB) for 2008 was 960/100000. It was reported that all South Africans lived in districts with Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course. However, the 2011 WHO report indicated South Africa as the only country in the world where the TB incidence is still rising. AIMS: To report the results of a TB prevalence survey and to determine the speed of TB case detection in the study communities. METHODS: In 2005 a TB prevalence survey was done to inform the sample size calculation for the ZAMSTAR (Zambia South Africa TB and AIDS Reduction) trial. It was a cluster survey with clustering by enumeration area; all households were visited within enumeration areas and informed consent obtained from eligible adults. A questionnaire was completed and a sputum sample collected from each adult. Samples were inoculated on both liquid mycobacterium growth indicator tube (MGIT) and Lowenstein-Jensen media. A follow-up HIV prevalence survey was done in 2007. RESULTS: In Community A, the adjusted prevalence of culture positive TB was 32/1000 (95\%CI 25-41/1000) and of smear positive TB 8/1000 (95\%CI 5-13/1000). In Community B, the adjusted prevalence of culture positive TB was 24/1000 (95\%CI 17-32/1000) and of smear positive TB 9/1000 (95\%CI 6-15/1000). In Community A the patient diagnostic rate was 0.38/person-year while in community B it was 0.30/person-year. In both communities the adjusted HIV prevalence was 25\% (19-30\%). DISCUSSION: In both communities a higher TB prevalence than national estimates and a low patient diagnostic rate was calculated, suggesting that cases are not detected at a sufficient rate to interrupt transmission. These findings may contribute to the rising TB incidence in South Africa. The TB epidemic should therefore be addressed rapidly and effectively, especially in the presence of the concurrently high HIV prevalence.},

We identified symptom screening rules to be used in addition to cough ≥2 weeks, in a context where X-ray screening is not feasible, aiming to increase the sensitivity of screening while achieving a specificity of ≥85\%. Methods We used 2010 Zambia South Africa Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS Reduction (ZAMSTAR) survey data: a South African (SA) training dataset, a SA testing dataset for internal validation and a Zambian dataset for external validation. Regression analyses investigated relationships between symptoms or combinations of symptoms and active disease. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for candidate rules. Results Among all participants, the sensitivity of using only cough ≥2 weeks as a screening rule was less than 25\% in both SA and Zambia. The addition of any three of six TB symptoms (cough {$<$}2 weeks, night sweats, weight loss, fever, chest pain, shortness of breath), or 2 or more of cough {$<$}2 weeks, night sweats, and weight loss, increased the sensitivity to \textasciitilde 38\%, while reducing specificity from \textasciitilde 95\% to \textasciitilde 85\% in SA and \textasciitilde 97\% to \textasciitilde 92\% in Zambia. Among HIV-negative adults, findings were similar in SA, whereas in Zambia the increase in sensitivity was relatively small (15\% to 22\%). Conclusion High TB burden countries should investigate cost-effective strategies for systematic screening: one such strategy could be to use our rule in addition to cough ≥2 weeks.},

Clinical outcomes are consistently poor on retreatment regimens, however reasons for this are unclear. This study aimed to explore factors which may contribute to unsuccessful outcomes in retreatment TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective cohort of consecutive patients starting WHO Category II retreatment regimen was recruited at a central hospital in Malawi. Participants were evaluated at baseline, after completion of the intensive phase at 2-months, and at the end of the 8-month treatment course. Patients were assessed for respiratory co-morbidity; anaemia; renal impairment; diabetes; Anti-retroviral (ART) failure; and drug toxicity. Amongst 158 patients entering TB care at the point of a recurrent episode, only 92 (58\%) had a microbiologically confirmed diagnosis. The prevalence of drug resistance was low (9.6\%). Of the 158 patients, 131 (83\%) were HIV-positive, of whom 96 (73\%) were on ART. Of 63 patients on ART {$>$}1 year, 24 (38\%) had ART failure. Chronic lung disease was found in 88\% on CT thorax, including scarring (80\%), bronchiectasis (61\%), COPD (22\%), and destroyed lung (19\%). Spirometry revealed restrictive deficit in 60\%, and obstructive deficit in 7\% of patients. Anaemia and renal impairment were common (34\% and 45\% respectively). Ototoxicity developed in 32\%, and nephrotoxicity in 15\%. 40\% of patients reported peripheral neuropathy. Liver injury developed in 4\%. CONCLUSIONS: If outcomes are to be improved in retreatment TB, there is an urgent need to address the impact of other co-morbid medical conditions including chronic lung disease, HIV and ART failure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Both HIV and schistosomiasis are major public health problems worldwide with 1.8 million new HIV infections, and up to 110 million untreated schistosomiasis cases globally. Although a causal link has not been established, there are strong suggestions that having schistosomiasis increases onward transmission of HIV from co-infected men to women. With both HIV and schistosomiasis treatment readily available in Malawi, there is a need to investigate the feasibility, acceptability and health impacts of joint management of these two hazards, with special focus on health education and demand-creation for fishermen. The aim of this project is to identify optimal models of delivering integrated HIV and schistosomiasis services for fishermen, particularly investigating the effect of using social networks, HIV self-test kits and beach clinic services in Mangochi, Malawi. METHODS: We have mapped 45 boat teams or landing sites for a 3-arm cluster randomized trial using "boat team" as the unit of randomization. The three arms are: 1) Standard of care (SOC) with leaflets explaining the importance of receiving presumptive treatment for schistosomiasis (praziquantel) and HIV services for fishermen, and two intervention arms of 2) SOC + a peer explaining the leaflet to his fellow fishermen in a boat team; and 3) arm 2 with HIV self-test kits delivered to the boat team fishermen by the peer. The primary outcomes measured at 9 months of trial delivery will compare differences between arms in the proportions of boat-team fishermen: 1) who self-report starting antiretroviral therapy or undergoing voluntary medical male circumcision; and 2) who have ≥1 S. haematobium egg seen on light microscopy of the filtrate from 10mls urine ("egg-positive"). DISCUSSION: This is the first evaluation of an integrated HIV and schistosomiasis services intervention for fishermen, particularly investigating the effect of using social networks, HIVST kits and beach clinic services.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Viral hepatitis is a major public health threat and a leading cause of death worldwide. Annual mortality from viral hepatitis is similar to that of other major infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Highly effective prevention measures and treatments have made the global elimination of viral hepatitis a realistic goal, endorsed by all WHO member states. Ambitious targets call for a global reduction in hepatitis-related mortality of 65\% and a 90\% reduction in new infections by 2030. This Commission draws together a wide range of expertise to appraise the current global situation and to identify priorities globally, regionally, and nationally needed to accelerate progress. We identify 20 heavily burdened countries that account for over 75\% of the global burden of viral hepatitis. Key recommendations include a greater focus on national progress towards elimination with support given, if necessary, through innovative financing measures to ensure elimination programmes are fully funded by 2020. In addition to further measures to improve access to vaccination and treatment, greater attention needs to be paid to access to affordable, high-quality diagnostics if testing is to reach the levels needed to achieve elimination goals. Simplified, decentralised models of care removing requirements for specialised prescribing will be required to reach those in need, together with sustained efforts to tackle stigma and discrimination. We identify key examples of the progress that has already been made in many countries throughout the world, demonstrating that sustained and coordinated efforts can be successful in achieving the WHO elimination goals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Control of tuberculosis in settings with high HIV prevalence is a pressing public health priority. We tested two active case-finding strategies to target long periods of infectiousness before diagnosis, which is typical of HIV-negative tuberculosis and is a key driver of transmission. METHODS: Clusters of neighbourhoods in the high-density residential suburbs of Harare, Zimbabwe, were randomised to receive six rounds of active case finding at 6-monthly intervals by either mobile van or door-to-door visits. Randomisation was done by selection of discs of two colours from an opaque bag, with one disc to represent every cluster, and one colour allocated to each intervention group before selection began. In both groups, adult ({$>$}/=16 years) residents volunteering chronic cough ({$>$}/=2 weeks) had two sputum specimens collected for fluorescence microscopy. Community health workers and cluster residents were not masked to intervention allocation, but investigators and laboratory staff were masked to allocation until final analysis. The primary outcome was the cumulative yield of smear-positive tuberculosis per 1000 adult residents, compared between intervention groups; analysis was by intention to treat. The secondary outcome was change in prevalence of culture-positive tuberculosis from before intervention to before round six of intervention in 12\% of randomly selected households from the two intervention groups combined; analysis was based on participants who provided sputum in the two prevalence surveys. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN84352452. FINDINGS: 46 study clusters were identified and randomly allocated equally between intervention groups, with 55 741 adults in the mobile van group and 54,691 in the door-to-door group at baseline. HIV prevalence was 21\% (1916/9060) and in the 6 months before intervention the smear-positive case notification rate was 2.8 per 1000 adults per year. The trial was completed as planned with no adverse events. The mobile van detected 255 smear-positive patients from 5466 participants submitting sputum compared with 137 of 4711 participants identified through door-to-door visits (adjusted risk ratio 1.48, 95\% CI 1.11-1.96, p=0.0087). The overall prevalence of culture-positive tuberculosis declined from 6.5 per 1000 adults (95\% CI 5.1-8.3) to 3.7 per 1000 adults (2.6-5.0; adjusted risk ratio 0.59, 95\% CI 0.40-0.89, p=0.0112). INTERPRETATION: Wide implementation of active case finding, particularly with a mobile van approach, could have rapid effects on tuberculosis transmission and disease. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust.},

  abstract = {SETTING: Harare's high density suburbs. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the burden, duration and risk factors for prevalent tuberculosis (TB) and explore potential control strategies. METHODS: Randomly selected adults had TB culture, symptom screen and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology. Prevalent TB was defined as undiagnosed or still culture-positive. Notification data and HIV prevalence in TB out-patients were used to estimate duration of infectiousness (prevalence/estimated incidence). RESULTS: Among 10 092 participants, 40 (0.40\%, 95\%CI 0.28-0.54) had prevalent smear-positive TB. HIV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.1, 95\%CI 1.6-6.3, population attributable fraction [PAF] 33\%), male sex (aOR 3.1, 95\%CI 1.5-6.4, PAF 40\%), and overcrowding (PAF 34\%) were significant risk factors, with past TB treatment significant for HIV-negative participants only (PAF 7\%). Recent household TB contact was not significant (PAF 10\%). HIV prevalence was 21.1\%; 76.9\% of HIV-positive participants were previously untested. Duration of infectiousness was at least 18 weeks in HIV-positive and approximately 1 year in HIV-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: Overcrowding, male sex and HIV infection were major risk factors for prevalent smear-positive TB. Reducing diagnostic delay may have greater potential to improve the control of prevalent TB than interventions targeted at household contacts, TB treatment outcomes, or TB-HIV interventions under current levels of awareness of HIV status.},

We extracted data from individual studies, and calculated pooled estimates of incidence and prevalence through hierarchical Bayesian meta-regression modelling. We also did subgroup analyses by region.

The overall pooled incidence of \emph{M tuberculosis} infection among prisoners was 15·0 (95\% credible interval [CrI] 3·8–41·6) per 100 person-years. The incidence of tuberculosis (per 100 000 person-years) among prisoners was highest in studies from the WHO African (2190 [95\% CrI 810–4840] cases) and South-East Asia (1550 [240–5300] cases) regions and in South America (970 [460–1860] cases), and lowest in North America (30 [20–50] cases) and the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region (270 [50–880] cases). The prevalence of tuberculosis was greater than 1000 per 100 000 prisoners in all global regions except for North America and the Western Pacific, and highest in the WHO South-East Asia region (1810 [95\% CrI 670–4000] cases per 100 000 prisoners). The incidence rate ratio between prisons and the general population was much higher in South America (26·9; 95\% CrI 17·1–40·1) than in other regions, but was nevertheless higher than ten in the WHO African (12·6; 6·2–22·3), Eastern Mediterranean (15·6; 6·5–32·5), and South-East Asia (11·7; 4·1–27·1) regions.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Globally, people in prison are at high risk of contracting \emph{M tuberculosis} infection and developing tuberculosis, with consistent disparities between prisons and the general population across regions.

However, timely information from these tests available via remote monitoring is underutilized. The failure to transmit real-time, actionable data to key individuals such as clinicians, patients, and national monitoring and evaluation teams may negatively impact patient care. OBJECTIVE: To describe recently developed applications that allow for real-time, remote monitoring of Xpert results, and initial implementation of one of these products in central Mozambique. DESIGN: In partnership with the Mozambican National Tuberculosis Program, we compared three different remote monitoring tools for Xpert and selected one, GxAlert, to pilot and evaluate at five public health centers in Mozambique. RESULTS: GxAlert software was successfully installed on all five Xpert computers, and test results are now uploaded daily via a USB internet modem to a secure online database. A password-protected web-based interface allows real-time analysis of test results, and 1200 positive tests for tuberculosis generated 8000 SMS result notifications to key individuals. CONCLUSION: Remote monitoring of diagnostic platforms is feasible in LMICs. While promising, this effort needs to address issues around patient data ownership, confidentiality, interoperability, unique patient identifiers, and data security.},

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) infection and disease in a remote tribal population. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey with two-stage screening for identification of cases. A stratified probability proportional sample with the hamlet as the unit. METHODS: Among 56 revenue divisions with a population of about 66,000, 24 revenue divisions were selected. Among 26,320 persons registered, children {$<$} 10 years were tuberculin tested and reactions were read after 72 hours. Those over 15 were X-rayed, and tuberculosis symptoms were investigated. Sputum was collected from those with abnormal X-ray or symptoms and examined for smear and culture positivity and sensitivity. RESULTS: Of the 6952 children tested and read, 5\% had BCG scars and the prevalence of infection was 5\%. The annual risk of infection was 1.1. Among adults, the prevalence of bacillary cases was 8/1000 and X-ray cases 29/1000. The prevalence of bacillary disease was higher among males, particularly with increasing age. Thirty symptomatic cases had normal X-rays and 63 X-ray cases had no symptoms. Thus prevalence would have been underestimated if either method had been used alone for screening. Isoniazid resistance was seen in 12\% of patients, two of whom also had rifampicin resistance (2.6\%).

Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of research articles comparing the accuracy of front-loaded or same-day microscopy and standard sputum smear microscopy for diagnosis of culture-confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. We searched Medline, Embase, Biosis, and Web of Science for articles published between Jan 1, 2005, and Feb 14, 2012. Two investigators identified eligible articles and extracted data for individual study sites. We generated pooled summary estimates (95\% CIs) for sensitivity and specificity by use of random-effects meta-analysis when four or more studies were available. Findings We identified eight relevant studies from five articles enrolling 7771 patients with suspected tuberculosis in low-income countries. Compared with the standard approach of examination of two smears with Ziehl-Neelsen light microscopy over 2 days, examination of two smears taken on the same day had much the same sensitivity (64\% [95\% CI 60 to 69] for standard microscopy vs 63\% [58 to 68] for same-day microscopy) and specificity (98\% [97 to 99] vs 98\% [97 to 99]). We noted similar results for studies employing light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy and for studies examining three smears, whether they were compared with two-smear strategies or with one another. Interpretation Same-day sputum smear microscopy is as accurate as standard smear microscopy. Data from tuberculosis programmes are needed to document the changes required in the health system to successfully implement the strategy and understand its effects.

Descriptions of patient costs associated with diagnosis use different protocols and are not comparable. METHODS: We aimed to describe the direct costs incurred by adults attending TB diagnostic centres in four countries and factors associated with expenditure for diagnosis. Surveys of 2225 adults attending smear-microscopy centres in Nigeria, Nepal, Ethiopia and Yemen. Adults {$>$}18 years with cough {$>$}2 weeks were enrolled prospectively. Direct costs were quantified using structured questionnaires. Patients with costs {$>$}75(th) quartile were considered to have high expenditure (cases) and compared with patients with costs {$<$}75(th) quartile to identify factors associated with high expenditure. RESULTS: The most significant expenses were due to clinic fees and transport. Most participants attended the centres with companions. High expenditure was associated with attending with company, residing in rural areas/other towns and illiteracy. CONCLUSIONS: The costs incurred by patients are substantial and share common patterns across countries. Removing user fees, transparent charging policies and reimbursing clinic expenses would reduce the poverty-inducing effects of direct diagnostic costs. In locations with limited resources, support could be prioritised for those most at risk of high expenditure; those who are illiterate, attend the service with company and rural residents.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in an adult population by using a screening questionnaire and sputum examination. DESIGN: A house-to-house visit was conducted. All those 14 years of age and above were screened for the presence of symptoms. Three sputum samples were collected from persons who had symptoms for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) examination. RESULTS: A total of 12,149 individuals were screened, of whom 173 had symptoms suggestive of TB. Twenty-three were positive for AFB (189/100,000, 95\% CI 112-267). No association was observed between smear positivity and socio-demographic factors. Only two of the 23 patients were on anti-tuberculosis treatment (8.7\%, 95\% CI 1.5-29.5). CONCLUSION: This simple and cost-effective method provides a fairly realistic estimate of the prevalence of TB. Thus with further development of the method it can be used to monitor the progress of TB programmes in resource-poor settings.},

The population was 36,334 in 2001, and the TB notification rate was 341 per 100,000 population for new smear-positive TB in 2002. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relative contributions of symptom and chest radiographic (CXR) screening in the detection of subjects with smear- and/or culture-positive TB in prevalence surveys. DESIGN: Information on symptoms, CXR abnormalities, sputum smear and culture was gathered from a random cluster sample of 1170 adults (aged {$>$} or = 15 years). Smear and/or culture-positive TB was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: Of 1170 adults, 29 had bacteriologically positive TB (smear- and/or culture-positive). The presence of any abnormalities on CXR had the highest sensitivity for detecting subjects with bacteriologically positive TB (0.97, 95\%CI 0.90-1.00). Specificity for any abnormalities on CXR was 0.67 (95\%CI 0.64-0.70). The specificity of any of five TB-related symptoms was 0.68 (95\%CI 0.65-0.71). Individual symptoms had low sensitivities, ranging from 0.10 for fever to 0.54 for cough of {$>$} or = 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: In this TB prevalence survey, CXR screening, but not symptom screening, was a sensitive alternative to sputum examination of all participants.},

We assessed the performance of WHO screening criteria and alternative screening tests/strategies to guide LF-LAM testing and compared diagnostic accuracy of the WHO AlereLAM algorithm (WHO screening criteria\,→\,AlereLAM) with AlereLAM and FujiLAM (a novel LF-LAM test). Methods : We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library from Jan 1, 2011 to March 1, 2020 for studies among adult/adolescent HIV-positive inpatients regardless of tuberculosis signs and symptoms. The reference standards were 1) AlereLAM or FujiLAM for screening tests/strategies and 2) culture or Xpert for AlereLAM/FujiLAM. We determined proportion of inpatients eligible for AlereLAM using WHO screening criteria; assessed accuracy of WHO criteria and alternative screening tests/strategies to guide LF-LAM testing; compared accuracy of WHO AlereLAM algorithm with AlereLAM/FujiLAM in all; and determined diagnostic yield of AlereLAM, FujiLAM, and Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert). We estimated pooled proportions with a random-effects model, assessed diagnostic accuracy using random-effects bivariate models, and assessed diagnostic yield descriptively. Findings : We obtained data from all 5 identified studies (n=3,504). The pooled proportion of inpatients eligible for AlereLAM using WHO criteria was 93\% (95\%CI 91, 95). Among screening tests/strategies to guide LF-LAM testing, WHO criteria, C-reactive protein (≥5 mg/L), and CD4 count ({$<$}200 cells/μL) had high sensitivities but low specificities; cough (≥2 weeks), haemoglobin ({$<$}8 g/dL), body mass index ({$<$}18.5 kg/m2), lymphadenopathy, and WHO-defined danger signs had higher specificities but suboptimal sensitivities. AlereLAM in all had the same sensitivity (62\%) and specificity (88\%) as WHO AlereLAM algorithm. Sensitivity of FujiLAM and AlereLAM was 69\% and 48\%, while specificity was 48\% and 96\%, respectively. Diagnostic yield of sputum Xpert was 29-41\%, AlereLAM was 39-76\%, and urine Xpert was 35-62\%. In one study, FujiLAM diagnosed 80\% of tuberculosis cases (vs 39\% for AlereLAM), and sputum Xpert combined with AlereLAM, urine Xpert, or FujiLAM diagnosed 69\%, 81\%, and 92\% of all cases, respectively. Interpretation : WHO criteria and alternative screening tests/strategies have limited utility in guiding LF-LAM testing, suggesting that AlereLAM testing in all HIV-positive medical inpatients be implemented. Routine FujiLAM may improve tuberculosis diagnosis. Funding : None.},

  abstract = {Background The WHO-recommended tuberculosis screening and diagnostic algorithm in ambulatory people living with HIV is a four-symptom screen (known as the WHO-recommended four symptom screen [W4SS]) followed by a WHO-recommended molecular rapid diagnostic test (eg Xpert MTB/RIF [hereafter referred to as Xpert]) if W4SS is positive. To inform updated WHO guidelines, we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of alternative screening tests and strategies for tuberculosis in this population. Methods In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we updated a search of PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, the Cochrane Library, and conference abstracts for publications from Jan 1, 2011, to March 12, 2018, done in a previous systematic review to include the period up to Aug 2, 2019. We screened the reference lists of identified pieces and contacted experts in the field. We included prospective cross-sectional, observational studies and randomised trials among adult and adolescent (age ≥10 years) ambulatory people living with HIV, irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis. We extracted study-level data using a standardised data extraction form, and we requested individual participant data from study authors. We aimed to compare the W4SS with alternative screening tests and strategies and the WHO-recommended algorithm (ie, W4SS followed by Xpert) with Xpert for all in terms of diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity), overall and in key subgroups (eg, by antiretroviral therapy [ART] status). The reference standard was culture. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020155895. Findings We identified 25 studies, and obtained data from 22 studies (including 15\,666 participants; 4347 [27·7\%] of 15\,663 participants with data were on ART). W4SS sensitivity was 82\% (95\% CI 72–89) and specificity was 42\% (29–57). C-reactive protein (≥10 mg/L) had similar sensitivity to (77\% [61–88]), but higher specificity (74\% [61–83]; n=3571) than, W4SS. Cough (lasting ≥2 weeks), haemoglobin ({$<$}10 g/dL), body-mass index ({$<$}18·5 kg/m2), and lymphadenopathy had high specificities (80–90\%) but low sensitivities (29–43\%). The WHO-recommended algorithm had a sensitivity of 58\% (50–66) and a specificity of 99\% (98–100); Xpert for all had a sensitivity of 68\% (57–76) and a specificity of 99\% (98–99). In the one study that assessed both, the sensitivity of sputum Xpert Ultra was higher than sputum Xpert (73\% [62–81] vs 57\% [47–67]) and specificities were similar (98\% [96–98] vs 99\% [98–100]). Among outpatients on ART (4309 [99·1\%] of 4347 people on ART), W4SS sensitivity was 53\% (35–71) and specificity was 71\% (51–85). In this population, a parallel strategy (two tests done at the same time) of W4SS with any chest x-ray abnormality had higher sensitivity (89\% [70–97]) and lower specificity (33\% [17–54]; n=2670) than W4SS alone; at a tuberculosis prevalence of 5\%, this strategy would require 379 more rapid diagnostic tests per 1000 people living with HIV than W4SS but detect 18 more tuberculosis cases. Among outpatients not on ART (11\,160 [71·8\%] of 15\,541 outpatients), W4SS sensitivity was 85\% (76–91) and specificity was 37\% (25–51). C-reactive protein (≥10 mg/L) alone had a similar sensitivity to (83\% [79–86]), but higher specificity (67\% [60–73]; n=3187) than, W4SS and a sequential strategy (both test positive) of W4SS then C-reactive protein (≥5 mg/L) had a similar sensitivity to (84\% [75–90]), but higher specificity than (64\% [57–71]; n=3187), W4SS alone; at 10\% tuberculosis prevalence, these strategies would require 272 and 244 fewer rapid diagnostic tests per 1000 people living with HIV than W4SS but miss two and one more tuberculosis cases, respectively. Interpretation C-reactive protein reduces the need for further rapid diagnostic tests without compromising sensitivity and has been included in the updated WHO tuberculosis screening guidelines. However, C-reactive protein data were scarce for outpatients on ART, necessitating future research regarding the utility of C-reactive protein in this group. Chest x-ray can be useful in outpatients on ART when combined with W4SS. The WHO-recommended algorithm has suboptimal sensitivity; Xpert for all offers slight sensitivity gains and would have major resource implications. Funding World Health Organization.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cases of smear-negative TB have increased dramatically in high prevalence HIV settings and pose considerable diagnostic and management challenges. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between February 2006 and July 2007, a cohort study nested within a cluster-randomised trial of community-based case finding strategies for TB in Harare, Zimbabwe was undertaken. Participants who had negative sputum smears and remained symptomatic of TB were follow-up for one year with standardised investigations including HIV testing, repeat sputum smears, TB culture and chest radiography. Defaulters were actively traced to the community. The objectives were to investigate the incidence and risk factors for TB. TB was diagnosed in 218 (18.2\%) participants, of which 39.4\% was bacteriologically confirmed. Most cases (84.2\%) were diagnosed within 3 months, but TB incidence remained high thereafter (111.3 per 1000 person-years, 95\% CI: 86.6 to 146.3). HIV prevalence was 63.3\%, and HIV-infected individuals had a 3.5-fold higher risk of tuberculosis than HIV-negative individuals. CONCLUSION: We found that diagnosis of TB was insensitive and slow, even with early radiography and culture. Until more sensitive and rapid diagnostic tests become widely available, a much more proactive and integrated approach towards prompt initiation of ART, ideally from within TB clinics and without waiting for TB to be excluded, is needed to minimise the risk and consequences of diagnostic delay.},

  abstract = {Introduction Over 40\% of global tuberculosis case notifications are diagnosed clinically without mycobacteriological confirmation. Standard diagnostic algorithms include ‘trial-of-antibiotics’—empirical antibiotic treatment given to mycobacteriology-negative individuals to treat infectious causes of symptoms other than tuberculosis, as a ‘rule-out’ diagnostic test for tuberculosis. Potentially 26.5 million such antibiotic courses/year are prescribed globally for the 5.3 million/year mycobacteriology-negative patients, making trial-of-antibiotics the most common tuberculosis diagnostic, and a global-scale risk for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Our systematic review found no randomised controlled trial (RCT) to support use of trial-of-antibiotic. The RCT aims to determine the diagnostic and clinical value and AMR consequences of trial-of-antibiotics. Methods and analysis A three-arm, open-label, RCT randomising (1:1:1) Malawian adults (≥18 years) seeking primary care for cough into: (a) azithromycin 500 mg one time per day for 3 days or (b) amoxicillin 1 g three times per day for 5 days or (c) standard-of-care (no immediate antibiotic). We will perform mycobacteriology tests (microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF (Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampicin) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture) at baseline. We will use audiocomputer-assisted self-interview to assess clinical improvement at day 8. First primary outcome will be proportion of patients reporting day 8 improvement out of those with negative mycobacteriology (specificity). Second primary outcome will be day 29 incidence of a composite endpoint of either death or hospitalisation or missed tuberculosis diagnosis. To determine AMR impact we compare proportion of resistant nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates on day 29. 400 mycobacteriology-negative participants/arm will be required to detect a ≥10\% absolute difference in diagnostic specificity with 80\% power. We will estimate measures of effect by comparing outcomes in antibiotic arms (combined and individually) to standard-of-care. Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed and approved by Malawi College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee, London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Research Ethics Committee and Regional Committee for Health and Research Ethics – Norway, and Malawi Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board. We will present abstracts at relevant conferences, and prepare a manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of patients with symptoms is the foundation of facility-based TB screening and diagnosis, but underdiagnosis is common. We conducted this systematic review with the hypothesis that underdiagnosis is largely secondary to patient drop out along the diagnostic and care pathway. METHODS: We searched (up to 22 January 2019) MEDLINE, Embase, and Cinahl for studies investigating patient pathway to TB diagnosis and care at health facilities. We used Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) to assess risk of bias. We reported proportions of patients with symptoms at each stage of the pathway from symptom screening to treatment initiation. RESULTS: After screening 3,558 abstracts, we identified 16 eligible studies. None provided data addressing the full cascade of care from clinical presentation to treatment initiation in the same patient population. Symptom screening, the critical entry point for diagnosis of TB, was not done for 3396\% of participants with symptoms in the three studies that reported this outcome. The proportion of attendees with symptoms offered a diagnostic investigation (data available for 15 studies) was very low with a study level median of 38\% (IQR 1444, range 484) CONCLUSIONS: Inefficiencies of the TB symptom screen-based patient pathway are a major contributor to underdiagnosis of TB, reflecting inconsistent implementation of guidelines to ask all patients attending health facilities about respiratory symptoms and to offer diagnostic tests to all patients promptly once TB symptoms are identified. Better screening tools and interventions to improve the efficiency of TB screening and diagnosis pathways in health facilities are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suboptimal diagnostics for pulmonary tuberculosis drive the use of the so-called trial of antibiotics, a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics without activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is given to patients who are mycobacteriology negative but symptomatic, with the aim of distinguishing pulmonary tuberculosis from bacterial lower respiratory tract infection. The underlying assumption-that patients with lower respiratory tract infection will improve, whereas those with pulmonary tuberculosis will not-has an unclear evidence base for such a widely used intervention (at least 26·5 million courses are prescribed per year). We aimed to collate available evidence on the diagnostic performance of the trial of antibiotics. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Global Health databases for studies published up to March 15, 2019, that investigated the sensitivity and specificity of the trial of antibiotics against mycobacteriology tests in adults (≥15 years) with tuberculosis symptoms. We used the QUADAS-2 tool to assess the risk of bias. We estimated pooled values for sensitivity and specificity of trial of antibiotics (as the index text) versus mycobacteriology tests (as the reference standard) using random-effects bivariate modelling, and we used the I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity between studies contributing to these estimates. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017083915. FINDINGS: Of the 9410 articles identified by our search, eight studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies were from seven countries in Africa, South America, and Asia, and involved 2786 participants. Six studies used mycobacterial culture as the reference standard, and six used penicillins for the trial of antibiotics. The treatment duration, number of antimicrobial courses, and definition of what constituted response to treatment varied substantially between studies. The pooled sensitivity (67\%, 95\% CI 42-85) and specificity (73\%, 58-85) of the trial of antibiotics versus mycobacteriology tests were below internationally defined minimum performance profiles for tuberculosis diagnostics and had substantial heterogeneity (I2 was 96\% for sensitivity and 99\% for specificity). Each included study failed on one or more domain of the QUADAS-2 tool. INTERPRETATION: Current policy and practice regarding the trial of antibiotics appear inappropriate, given the weak evidence base, poor diagnostic performance, potential contribution to the global antimicrobial resistance crisis, and adverse individual and public health consequences from the misclassification of tuberculosis status. Antibiotic strategies during tuberculosis investigations should instead optimise clinical outcomes, ideally guided by clinical trials in both inpatient and outpatient groups.

We conducted a cross-sectional face-to-face survey of adults in 2011, enumerating “close” (shared conversation) and “casual” (shared indoor space) social contacts in 16 Zambian communities and 8 South African communities. We modeled the incidence of M. tuberculosis infection in all age groups using these contact patterns, as well as the observed incidence of M. tuberculosis infection in children and the prevalence of tuberculosis disease in adults. A total of 3,528 adults participated in the study. The reported rates of close and casual contact were 4.9 per adult per day (95\% confidence interval: 4.6, 5.2) and 10.4 per adult per day (95\% confidence interval: 9.3, 11.6), respectively. Rates of close contact were higher for adults in larger households and rural areas. There was preferential mixing of close contacts within age groups and within sexes. The estimated incidence of M. tuberculosis infection in adults was 1.5–6 times higher (2.5\%–10\% per year) than that in children. More than 50\% of infections in men, women, and children were estimated to be due to contact with adult men. We conclude that estimates of infection incidence based on surveys in children might underestimate incidence in adults. Most infections may be due to contact with adult men. Treatment and control of tuberculosis in men is critical to protecting men, women, and children from tuberculosis.},

METHODS: For countries where incidence estimates derived from a factor adjustment of notifications and case detection ratio over 0.85, or with {$<$}1000 reported TB cases, we disaggregated incidence proportional to notifications. For each other country, a prior was constructed using a hierarchical model of age-stratified prevalence survey data, meta-analysis of sex ratios, and mathematical modelling for children under 15\,years. Samples from this prior were used to disaggregate incidence and accepted if incidence exceeded notifications in each age/sex category. Results were inspected and, if implausible, incidence was disaggregated proportional to notifications. Mortality was disaggregated proportional to patterns in vital registration (VR) data in countries with VR data. Where VR data were lacking, a case-fatality ratio (CFR) approach was applied to estimated incidence, with separate CFRs by HIV/ART status, child/adult age groups, and anti-TB treatment status. Uncertainty in all disaggregated country estimates was constructed to be consistent with corresponding overall uncertainty. RESULTS: We generated disaggregated results for 216 countries. For 125 countries, incidence disaggregation was based on notifications. Of the rest, accepted samples from the prior were considered implausible in 4 countries. For 72 countries, mortality disaggregation was based on VR data; the rest were based on the CFR approach. CONCLUSIONS: While multi-stage, this approach is comparatively simple in overall logic. Disaggregated estimates have relatively larger uncertainty and should be used with caution.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: It has become increasingly common for preference-based measures of health-related quality of life to be used in the evaluation of different health-care interventions. For one such measure, The EuroQol, designed to be used for these purposes, it was necessary to derive a single index value for each of the 243 health states it generates. The problem was that it was virtually impossible to generate direct valuations for all of these states, and thus it was necessary to find a procedure that allows the valuations of all EuroQol states to be interpolated from direct valuations on a subset of these. METHODS: In a recent study, direct valuations were elicited for 42 EuroQol health states (using the time trade-off method) from a representative sample of the UK population. This article reports on the methodology that was adopted to build up a "tariff" of EuroQol values from this data. RESULTS: A parsimonious model that fits the data well was defined as one in which valuations were explained in terms of the level of severity associated with each dimension, an intercept associated with any move away from full health, and a term that picked up whether any dimension in the state was at its most severe level. CONCLUSIONS: The model presented in this article appears to predict the values of the states for which there are direct observations and, thus, can be used to interpolate values for the states for which no direct observations exist.},

METHODS: A cluster survey in eight Afghan provinces, chosen based on population density and geographic distribution, was carried out between October and February 2006. Interviews were conducted and tuberculin skin tests were administered and read. FINDINGS: 11,413 individuals participated in the study. Using the international standard cut-off of {$>$}or= 10 mm, tuberculosis prevalence and annual risk of infection in the population were 15\% (CI: 14.4-15.7) and 0.80 (CI: 0.76-0.84), respectively. Tuberculosis prevalence was higher in rural than in urban areas. Other risk factors included age, prior tuberculosis treatment or contact, productive cough or cough {$>$}3 weeks, no prior bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination and a cooking fire in the sleeping room. CONCLUSIONS: The survey documented a lower prevalence and risk of tuberculosis infection than the 1978 national survey and a substantially lower estimate of incidence of new smear-positive tuberculosis cases than World Health Organization estimates. However, other findings suggest that active tuberculosis may remain widespread and undiagnosed, and indicate a need for both additional research and continued investment in tuberculosis treatment and prevention, and in health infrastructure.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) rates among Tibetan refugee children and adolescents attending boarding schools in India are extremely high. We undertook a comprehensive case finding and TB preventive treatment (TPT) program in 7 schools in the Zero TB Kids project. We aimed to measure the TB infection and disease burden and investigate the risk of TB disease in children and adults who did and did not receive TPT in the schools. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A mobile team annually screened children and staff for TB at the 7 boarding schools in Himachal Pradesh, India, using symptom criteria, radiography, molecular diagnostics, and tuberculin skin tests. TB infection (TBI) was treated with short-course regimens of isoniazid and rifampin or rifampin. TB disease was treated according to Tibetan and Indian guidelines. Between April 2017 and December 2019, 6,582 schoolchildren (median age 14 [IQR 11-16] years) and 807 staff (median age 40 [IQR 33-48] years) were enrolled. Fifty-one percent of the students and 58\% of the staff were females. Over 13,161 person-years of follow-up in schoolchildren (median follow-up 2.3 years) and 1,800 person-years of follow-up in staff (median follow-up 2.5 years), 69 TB episodes occurred in schoolchildren and 4 TB episodes occurred in staff, yielding annual incidence rates of 524/100,000 (95\% CI 414-663/100,000) person-years and 256/100,000 (95\% CI 96-683/100,000) person-years, respectively. Of 1,412 schoolchildren diagnosed with TBI, 1,192 received TPT. Schoolchildren who received TPT had 79\% lower risk of TB disease (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.21; 95\% CI 0.07-0.69; p = 0.010) compared to non-recipients, the primary study outcome. Protection was greater in recent contacts (aHR 0.07; 95\% CI 0.01-0.42; p = 0.004), the secondary study outcome. The prevalence of recent contacts was 28\% (1,843/6,582). Two different TPT regimens were used (3HR and 4R), and both were apparently effective. No staff receiving TPT developed TB. Overall, between 2017 and 2019, TB disease incidence decreased by 87\%, from 837/100,000 (95\% CI 604-1,129/100,000) person-years to 110/100,000 (95\% CI 36-255/100,000) person-years (p {$<$} 0.001), and TBI prevalence decreased by 42\% from 19\% (95\% CI 18\%-20\%) to 11\% (95\% CI 10\%-12\%) (p {$<$} 0.001). A limitation of our study is that TB incidence could be influenced by secular trends during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, following implementation of a school-wide TB screening and preventive treatment program, we observed a significant reduction in the burden of TB disease and TBI in children and adolescents. The benefit of TPT was particularly marked for recent TB contacts. This initiative may serve as a model for TB detection and prevention in children and adolescents in other communities affected by TB.},

  abstract = {Background The Xpert MTB/RIF assay is an automated molecular test that has improved the detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance, but its sensitivity is inadequate in patients with paucibacillary disease or HIV. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) was developed to overcome this limitation. We compared the diagnostic performance of Xpert Ultra with that of Xpert for detection of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. Methods In this prospective, multicentre, diagnostic accuracy study, we recruited adults with pulmonary tuberculosis symptoms presenting at primary health-care centres and hospitals in eight countries (South Africa, Uganda, Kenya, India, China, Georgia, Belarus, and Brazil). Participants were allocated to the case detection group if no drugs had been taken for tuberculosis in the past 6 months or to the multidrug-resistance risk group if drugs for tuberculosis had been taken in the past 6 months, but drug resistance was suspected. Demographic information, medical history, chest imaging results, and HIV test results were recorded at enrolment, and each participant gave at least three sputum specimen on 2 separate days. Xpert and Xpert Ultra diagnostic performance in the same sputum specimen was compared with culture tests and drug susceptibility testing as reference standards. The primary objectives were to estimate and compare the sensitivity of Xpert Ultra test with that of Xpert for detection of smear-negative tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance and to estimate and compare Xpert Ultra and Xpert specificities for detection of rifampicin resistance. Study participants in the case detection group were included in all analyses, whereas participants in the multidrug-resistance risk group were only included in analyses of rifampicin-resistance detection. Findings Between Feb 18, and Dec 24, 2016, we enrolled 2368 participants for sputum sampling. 248 participants were excluded from the analysis, and 1753 participants were distributed to the case detection group (n=1439) and the multidrug-resistance risk group (n=314). Sensitivities of Xpert Ultra and Xpert were 63\% and 46\%, respectively, for the 137 participants with smear-negative and culture-positive sputum (difference of 17\%, 95\% CI 10 to 24); 90\% and 77\%, respectively, for the 115 HIV-positive participants with culture-positive sputum (13\%, 6·4 to 21); and 88\% and 83\%, respectively, across all 462 participants with culture-positive sputum (5·4\%, 3·3 to 8·0). Specificities of Xpert Ultra and Xpert for case detection were 96\% and 98\% (−2·7\%, −3·9 to −1·7) overall, and 93\% and 98\% for patients with a history of tuberculosis. Xpert Ultra and Xpert performed similarly in detecting rifampicin resistance. Interpretation For tuberculosis case detection, sensitivity of Xpert Ultra was superior to that of Xpert in patients with paucibacillary disease and in patients with HIV. However, this increase in sensitivity came at the expense of a decrease in specificity.

  abstract = {The importance of high-incidence "hotspots" to population-level tuberculosis (TB) incidence remains poorly understood. TB incidence varies widely across countries, but within smaller geographic areas (e.g., cities), TB transmission may be more homogeneous than other infectious diseases. We constructed a steady-state compartmental model of TB in Rio de Janeiro, replicating nine epidemiological variables (e.g., TB incidence) within 1\% of their observed values. We estimated the proportion of TB transmission originating from a high-incidence hotspot (6.0\% of the city's population, 16.5\% of TB incidence) and the relative impact of TB control measures targeting the hotspot vs. the general community. If each case of active TB in the hotspot caused 0.5 secondary transmissions in the general community for each within-hotspot transmission, the 6.0\% of people living in the hotspot accounted for 35.3\% of city-wide TB transmission. Reducing the TB transmission rate (i.e., number of secondary infections per infectious case) in the hotspot to that in the general community reduced city-wide TB incidence by 9.8\% in year 5, and 29.7\% in year 50-an effect similar to halving time to diagnosis for the remaining 94\% of the community. The importance of the hotspot to city-wide TB control depended strongly on the extent of TB transmission from the hotspot to the general community. High-incidence hotspots may play an important role in propagating TB epidemics. Achieving TB control targets in a hotspot containing 6\% of a city's population can have similar impact on city-wide TB incidence as achieving the same targets throughout the remaining community.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by a subclinical phase (symptoms absent or not considered abnormal); prediagnostic phase (symptoms noticed but diagnosis not pursued); and clinical phase (care actively sought). Diagnostic capacity during these phases is limited. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the population-level impact of TB case-finding strategies in the presence of subclinical and prediagnostic disease. METHODS: We created a mathematical epidemic model of TB, calibrated to global incidence. We then introduced three prototypical diagnostic interventions: increased sensitivity of diagnosis in the clinical phase by 20\% ("passive"); early diagnosis during the prediagnostic phase at a rate of 10\% per year ("enhanced"); and population-based diagnosis of 5\% of undiagnosed prevalent cases per year ("active"). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: If the subclinical phase was ignored, as in most models, the passive strategy was projected to reduce TB incidence by 18\% (90\% uncertainty range [UR], 11-32\%) by year 10, compared with 23\% (90\% UR, 14-35\%) for the enhanced strategy and 18\% (90\% UR, 11-28\%) for the active strategy. After incorporating a subclinical phase into the model, consistent with population-based prevalence surveys, the active strategy still reduced 10-year TB incidence by 16\% (90\% UR, 11-28\%), but the passive and enhanced strategies' impact was attenuated to 11\% (90\% UR, 8-25\%) and 6\% (90\% UR, 4-13\%), respectively. The degree of attenuation depended strongly on the transmission rate during the subclinical phase. CONCLUSIONS: Subclinical disease may limit the impact of current diagnostic strategies for TB. Active detection of undiagnosed prevalent cases may achieve greater population-level TB control than increasing passive case detection.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}More than 10 years have elapsed since human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination was implemented. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the population-level impact of vaccinating girls and women against human papillomavirus on HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CIN2+) to summarise the most recent evidence about the effectiveness of HPV vaccines in real-world settings and to quantify the impact of multiple age-cohort vaccination.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}In this updated systematic review and meta-analysis, we used the same search strategy as in our previous paper. We searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Feb 1, 2014, and Oct 11, 2018. Studies were eligible if they compared the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of at least one HPV-related endpoint (genital HPV infections, anogenital wart diagnoses, or histologically confirmed CIN2+) between pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods among the general population and if they used the same population sources and recruitment methods before and after vaccination. Our primary assessment was the relative risk (RR) comparing the frequency (prevalence or incidence) of HPV-related endpoints between the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination periods. We stratified all analyses by sex, age, and years since introduction of HPV vaccination. We used random-effects models to estimate pooled relative risks.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We identified 1702 potentially eligible articles for this systematic review and meta-analysis, and included 65 articles in 14 high-income countries: 23 for HPV infection, 29 for anogenital warts, and 13 for CIN2+. After 5–8 years of vaccination, the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 decreased significantly by 83\% (RR 0·17, 95\% CI 0·11–0·25) among girls aged 13–19 years, and decreased significantly by 66\% (RR 0·34, 95\% CI 0·23–0·49) among women aged 20–24 years. The prevalence of HPV 31, 33, and 45 decreased significantly by 54\% (RR 0·46, 95\% CI 0·33–0·66) among girls aged 13–19 years. Anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 67\% (RR 0·33, 95\% CI 0·24–0·46) among girls aged 15–19 years, decreased significantly by 54\% (RR 0·46, 95\% CI 0.36–0.60) among women aged 20–24 years, and decreased significantly by 31\% (RR 0·69, 95\% CI 0·53–0·89) among women aged 25–29 years. Among boys aged 15–19 years anogenital wart diagnoses decreased significantly by 48\% (RR 0·52, 95\% CI 0·37–0·75) and among men aged 20–24 years they decreased significantly by 32\% (RR 0·68, 95\% CI 0·47–0·98). After 5–9 years of vaccination, CIN2+ decreased significantly by 51\% (RR 0·49, 95\% CI 0·42–0·58) among screened girls aged 15–19 years and decreased significantly by 31\% (RR 0·69, 95\% CI 0·57–0·84) among women aged 20–24 years.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}This updated systematic review and meta-analysis includes data from 60 million individuals and up to 8 years of post-vaccination follow-up. Our results show compelling evidence of the substantial impact of HPV vaccination programmes on HPV infections and CIN2+ among girls and women, and on anogenital warts diagnoses among girls, women, boys, and men.

Existing evidence has demonstrated that there is substantial local variation in the prevalence of HIV; however, subnational variation has not been investigated at a high spatial resolution across the continent. Here we explore within-country variation at a 5~×~5-km resolution in sub-Saharan Africa by estimating the prevalence of HIV among adults (aged 15-49~years) and the corresponding number of people living with HIV from 2000 to 2017. Our analysis reveals substantial within-country variation in the prevalence of HIV throughout sub-Saharan Africa and local differences in both the direction and rate of change in HIV prevalence between 2000 and 2017, highlighting the degree to which important local differences are masked when examining trends at the country level. These fine-scale estimates of HIV prevalence across space and time provide an important tool for precisely targeting the interventions that are necessary to bringing HIV infections under control in sub-Saharan Africa.},

  abstract = {SETTING: Khon Kaen Province, North-East Thailand. OBJECTIVE: To develop a rapid and cheap method of surveying a population cluster (a village) to establish the prevalence of sputum-positive tuberculosis. DESIGN: Based on previous experience a standardized 'rapid village survey' method was designed and tested. In this method a survey team of health workers is constituted and trained. Before and at the beginning of a visit to a village the population receives information about tuberculosis, and only individuals with chest symptoms are invited to report voluntarily to the survey team for examination. Active tracing of a previously compiled 'list of suspects and contacts' complements the identification of cases. The number of community members to be examined is thus much lower. A cluster sample of the provincial population was made (20,730 people in 40 villages). The population in each village was surveyed first by the Rapid Village Survey method, then, 1 week later, by the conventional method of examining every individual registered in each village. RESULTS: In the rapid village survey 14 cases of sputum-positive tuberculosis were detected and in the conventional survey 15 cases. CONCLUSION: The rapid method produces results comparable to the survey of the total sample population for less than half of the cost.},

This document provides evidence-based and best-practice policy recommendations for contact tracing among high- and medium-priority contacts in a variety of settings. It provides a basis for national guidelines on contact investigation and tuberculosis outbreak management, and should support countries and tuberculosis control managers in evaluating and revising national policies. A review of existing guidelines, a literature search, several meetings and consultation with experts were used to formulate and grade recommendations for action during contact investigation. Available tests to identify individuals with latent infection with M. tuberculosis are designed to identify immune response against mycobacterial antigens and have variable predictive value for the likelihood to develop active tuberculosis in different populations. Contact investigation should therefore be limited to situations with a clear likelihood of transmission or to those with a higher probability of developing active tuberculosis, for instance, young children and immunocompromised persons. A risk assessment-based approach is recommended, where the need to screen contacts is prioritised on the basis of the infectiousness of the index case, intensity of exposure and susceptibility of contacts.},

  abstract = {Community-based active case-finding (ACF) may have important impacts on routine TB case-detection and subsequent patient-initiated diagnosis pathways, contributing “indirectly” to infectious diseases prevention and care. We investigated the impact of ACF beyond directly diagnosed patients for TB, using routine case-notification rate (CNR) ratios as a measure of indirect effect. We systematically searched for publications 01-Jan-1980 to 13-Apr-2020 reporting on community-based ACF interventions compared to a comparison group, together with review of linked manuscripts reporting knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) outcomes or qualitative data on TB testing behaviour. We calculated CNR ratios of routine case-notifications (i.e. excluding cases identified directly through ACF) and compared proxy behavioural outcomes for both ACF and comparator communities. Full text manuscripts from 988 of 23,883 abstracts were screened for inclusion; 36 were eligible. Of these, 12 reported routine notification rates separately from ACF intervention-attributed rates, and one reported any proxy behavioural outcomes. Two further studies were identified from screening 1121 abstracts for linked KAP/qualitative manuscripts. 8/12 case-notification studies were considered at critical or serious risk of bias. 8/11 non-randomised studies reported bacteriologically-confirmed CNR ratios between 0.47 (95\% CI:0.41–0.53) and 0.96 (95\% CI:0.94–0.97), with 7/11 reporting all-form CNR ratios between 0.96 (95\% CI:0.88–1.05) and 1.09 (95\% CI:1.02–1.16). One high-quality randomised-controlled trial reported a ratio of 1.14 (95\% CI 0.91–1.43). KAP/qualitative manuscripts provided insufficient evidence to establish the impact of ACF on subsequent TB testing behaviour. ACF interventions with routine CNR ratios {$>$}1 suggest an indirect effect on wider TB case-detection, potentially due to impact on subsequent TB testing behaviour through follow-up after a negative ACF test or increased TB knowledge. However, data on this type of impact are rarely collected. Evaluation of routine case-notification, testing and proxy behavioural outcomes in intervention and comparator communities should be included as standard methodology in future ACF campaign study designs.},

International guidelines recommend systematic TB screening at health facilities in high-burden settings, but implementation is challenging. To construct a TB diagnosis care cascade, we investigated screening guideline adherence and completion of TB testing steps in Blantyre, Malawi. Methods A prospective cohort recruited adult (≥18) outpatients attending Bangwe acute-care primary clinic between 21/5/2018 and 6/9/2018. Entry interviews recording TB symptoms and demographic characteristics were linked to exit interviews by biometrics. Care cascades were constructed to estimate the proportion of patients progressing through each step of the diagnostic pathway. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with being asked to submit sputum. Results Of 5,442 clinic attendances 2,397 (44\%) had exit interviews. In clinically indicated participants (n=330) 203 (61.5\%) were asked about cough, 39 (11.8\%) were asked for sputum, 27 (8.2\%) gave sputum and 1 (0.3\%) received same-day results. Significant associations with request for sputum were: any TB symptom (aOR:3.20, 95\%CI:2.02-5.06), increasing age (aOR:1.02, 95\%CI:1.01-1.04 per year) and for HIV-negative participants only, a history of previous TB (aOR:3.37, 95\%CI:1.45-7.81). Numbers requiring sputum survey (20/day) outnumbered diagnostic capacity (8-12/day). Conclusion Patients were lost at every stage of the TB care cascade, with same day sputum submission achieved in only 8.2\% if clinically indicated.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Medication adherence is often suboptimal for adolescents with HIV, and establishing correct weight-based antiretroviral therapy dosing is difficult, contributing to virological failure. This review aimed to determine the proportion of adolescents achieving virological suppression after initiating ART. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies published between January 2004 and September 2014 including ≥50 adolescents taking ART and reporting on the proportion of virological suppressed participants were included. RESULTS: From a total of 5316 potentially relevant citations, 20 studies were included. Only eight studies reported the proportion of adolescents that were virologically suppressed at a specified time point. The proportion of adolescents with virological suppression at 12~months ranged from 27 to 89\%. CONCLUSION: Adolescent achievement of HIV virological suppression was highly variable. Improved reporting of virological outcomes from a wider range of settings is required to support efforts to improve HIV care and treatment for adolescents.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An unprecedented number of nationwide tuberculosis (TB) prevalence surveys will be implemented between 2010 and 2015, to better estimate the burden of disease caused by TB and assess whether global targets for TB control set for 2015 are achieved. It is crucial that results are analysed using best-practice methods. OBJECTIVE: To provide new theoretical and practical guidance on best-practice methods for the analysis of TB prevalence surveys, including analyses at the individual as well as cluster level and correction for biases arising from missing data. ANALYTIC METHODS: TB prevalence surveys have a cluster sample survey design; typically 50-100 clusters are selected, with 400-1000 eligible individuals in each cluster. The strategy recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for diagnosing pulmonary TB in a nationwide survey is symptom and chest X-ray screening, followed by smear microscopy and culture examinations for those with an abnormal X-ray and/or TB symptoms. Three possible methods of analysis are described and explained. Method 1 is restricted to participants, and individuals with missing data on smear and/or culture results are excluded. Method 2 includes all eligible individuals irrespective of participation, through multiple missing value imputation. Method 3 is restricted to participants, with multiple missing value imputation for individuals with missing smear and/or culture results, and inverse probability weighting to represent all eligible individuals. The results for each method are then compared and illustrated using data from the 2007 national TB prevalence survey in the Philippines. Simulation studies are used to investigate the performance of each method. KEY FINDINGS: A cluster-level analysis, and Methods 1 and 2, gave similar prevalence estimates (660 per 100,000 aged {$>$}/= 10 years old), with a higher estimate using Method 3 (680 per 100,000). Simulation studies for each of 4 plausible scenarios show that Method 3 performs best, with Method 1 systematically underestimating TB prevalence by around 10\%. CONCLUSION: Both cluster-level and individual-level analyses should be conducted, and individual-level analyses should be conducted both with and without multiple missing value imputation. Method 3 is the safest approach to correct the bias introduced by missing data and provides the single best estimate of TB prevalence at the population level.},

  abstract = {Investigation of contacts of patients with tuberculosis (TB) is a priority for TB control in high-income countries, and is increasingly being considered in resource-limited settings. This review was commissioned for a World Health Organization Expert Panel to develop global contact investigation guidelines. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies reporting the prevalence of TB and latent TB infection, and the annual incidence of TB among contacts of patients with TB. After screening 9,555 titles, we included 203 published studies. In 95 studies from low- and middle-income settings, the prevalence of active TB in all contacts was 3.1\% (95\% CI 2.2-4.4\%, I(2)=99.4\%), microbiologically proven TB was 1.2\% (95\% CI 0.9-1.8\%, I(2)=95.9\%), and latent TB infection was 51.5\% (95\% CI 47.1-55.8\%, I(2)=98.9\%). The prevalence of TB among household contacts was 3.1\% (95\% CI 2.1-4.5\%, I(2)=98.8\%) and among contacts of patients with multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant TB was 3.4\% (95\% CI 0.8-12.6\%, I(2)=95.7\%). Incidence was greatest in the first year after exposure. In 108 studies from high-income settings, the prevalence of TB among contacts was 1.4\% (95\% CI 1.1-1.8\%, I(2)=98.7\%), and the prevalence of latent infection was 28.1\% (95\% CI 24.2-32.4\%, I(2)=99.5\%). There was substantial heterogeneity among published studies. Contacts of TB patients are a high-risk group for developing TB, particularly within the first year. Children {$<$}5 yrs of age and people living with HIV are particularly at risk. Policy recommendations must consider evidence of the cost-effectiveness of various contact tracing strategies, and also incorporate complementary strategies to enhance case finding.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Despite health centres being the first point of contact of care, there are challenges faced in providing care to patients at this level. In Malawi, service provision barriers reported at this level included long waiting times, high numbers of patients and erratic consultation systems which lead to mis-diagnosis and delayed referrals. Proper case management at this level of care is critical to prevent severe disease and deaths in children. We aimed to adopt Emergency, Triage, Assessment and Treatment algorithm (ETAT) to improve ability to identify severe illness in children at primary health centre (PHC) through comparison with secondary level diagnoses.                                         Methods               We implemented ETAT mobile Health (mHealth) at eight urban PHCs in Blantyre, Malawi between April 2017 and September 2018. Health workers and support staff were trained in mHealth ETAT. Stabilisation rooms were established and equipped with emergency equipment. All PHCs used an electronic tracking system to triage and track sick children on referral to secondary care, facilitated by a unique barcode. Support staff at PHC triaged sick children using ETAT Emergency (E), Priority (P) and Queue (Q) symptoms and clinician gave clinical diagnosis. The secondary level diagnosis was considered as a gold standard. We used statistical computing software R (v3.5.1) and used exact 95\% binomial confidence intervals when estimating diagnosis agreement proportions.                                         Results                                Eight-five percentage of all cases where assigned to E (9.0\%) and P (75.5\%) groups. Pneumonia was the most common PHC level diagnosis across all three triage groups (E, P, Q). The PHC level diagnosis of trauma was the most commonly confirmed diagnosis at secondary level facility (85.0\%), while a PHC diagnosis of pneumonia was least likely to be confirmed at secondary level (39.6\%). The secondary level diagnosis least likely to have been identified at PHC level was bronchiolitis 3 (5.2\%). The majority of bronchiolitis cases (                 n                 \,=\,50; (86.2\%) were classified as pneumonia at the PHC level facility.                                                        Conclusions               Implementing a sustainable and consistent ETAT approach with stabilisation and treatment capacity at PHC level reinforce staff capacity to diagnose and has the potential to reduce other health system costs through fewer, timely and appropriate referrals.},

METHODS: Using cluster sampling, 50 rural panchayats (villages) and three urban units in Tiruvallur district were selected randomly. All adults aged {$>$} or = 15 years underwent symptom and radiographic examination, and those with abnormal shadows and/or chest symptoms had sputum smear and culture examination. In another cluster sample of 73 villages and three urban units, all children aged {$<$} 10 years were tuberculin tested. RESULTS: The prevalence of culture-positive and smear-positive tuberculosis was respectively 605 and 323/100,000. Both increased appreciably with age, and were substantially higher in males than in females at all ages; the overall male:female ratio was 5.5 for culture-positive and 6.5 for smear-positive tuberculosis. The ARTI in children aged under 10 years was 1.6\%, and was unaffected by sex. Over three decades there was an overall decline of 1.8\% per annum in the prevalence of culture-positive and 2.1\% for smear-positive tuberculosis.

A series of disease surveys were undertaken in rural community in Tiruvallur district in Tamilnadu, south India OBJECTIVE: To investigate the yield of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) cases by different symptoms status and suggest predominant symptoms for detection of cases in the community based surveys. METHODS: Three disease surveys were conducted during 1999-2006, in a random sample of 82,000 adults aged {$>$} or = 15 years to estimate the prevalence and incidence of pulmonary TB. All subjects were screened for chest symptoms and chest radiography. Sputum examination was done among those who were either symptomatic or abnormal on X-ray or both. Cases observed through symptom inquiry were included for analysis. RESULTS: In survey-I, 65.6\% had cough of {$>$} or = 14 days and yielded 79.1\% of the total cases. In surveys II and III, symptomatic subjects with cough contributed 69.5\% and 69.2\% of the cases respectively. In survey I, 26.8\% had symptoms without cough but with at least chest pain {$>$} or = 1 month contributed 8.4\% of total cases. The corresponding proportions in subsequent surveys were 29.3, 11.5\%; and 23.4, 11.2\% respectively. The number of symptomatics without cough and chest pain but with fever {$>$} or = 1 month was negligible. CONCLUSION: The relative importance of cough as a predominant symptom was reiterated. The yield of pulmonary TB cases from symptomatics having fever of {$>$} or = 1 month was negligible. Fever may be excluded from the definition of symptomatics for screening the population in community surveys.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reduces bone mineral density, mineralisation and turnover, and may impair fracture healing. SETTING: This prospective cohort study in South Africa investigated whether HIV infection was associated with impaired fracture healing following trauma. METHODS: All adults with acute tibia and femur fractures who underwent intermedullary nailing (IM) for fracture fixation between September 2017 and December 2018, at two tertiary hospitals, were followed for a minimum of 12 months post-operatively. The primary outcome was delayed bone union at 6 months (defined by the radiological union scoring system for the tibia [RUST] score {$<$}9), and the secondary outcome was non-union (defined as RUST score {$<$}9) at 9 months. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to investigate associations between HIV status and impaired fracture healing. RESULTS: In total, 358 participants, who underwent 395 IM nailings, were enrolled in the study and followed up for 12 months. Seventy-one participants (71/358, 19·8\%) were HIV positive (83 IM nailings [83/395], 21.0\%). HIV was not associated with delayed fracture healing after IM nailing of the tibia or femur (multivariable odds ratio [OR]: 1·06; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0·50-2·22). Participants with HIV had a statistically significant lower odds of non-union compared to HIV-negative participants (multivariable OR: 0·17; 95\% CI: 0·01-0·92). CONCLUSIONS: Fractures sustained in HIV-positive individuals can undergo surgical fixation as effectively as those in individuals who are HIV negative, with no increased risk of delayed union or non-union.},

DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study, conducted in Lima, Peru, from  June to September 2008, estimated the incidence of TB disease among household contacts of MDR-TB patients in 358 households. RESULTS: Of 2112 household contacts in 80 households (22\% of households), 108 (5\%) developed TB disease during the study, giving an incidence rate of 2360 per 100\,000  contact follow-up years for each of the first 3 years after exposure. Drug susceptibility tests (DST) were available for 50 diseased contacts, of whom 36 (80\%) had MDR-TB. Forty-two pairs of index-contact DSTs were available, among which the contact had an identical or less resistant phenotype  than the index case in 27 pairs. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that male contacts (hazard ratio [HR] 2.8, P {$<$} 0.05), with previous TB disease (HR 20.7, P {$<$} 0.001) and with associated (non-human immunodeficiency virus) comorbidities (HR 11.2, P {$<$} 0.001)  were more likely to develop TB. CONCLUSION: The high percentage of diseased household contacts highlights an opportunity for household-level interventions to prevent transmission, whether or not these cases were all attributable to the index case.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa combined with weak routine virological monitoring has driven increasing HIV drug resistance. We investigated ART failure, drug resistance, and early mortality among patients with HIV admitted to hospital in Malawi. METHODS: This observational cohort study was nested within the rapid urine-based screening for tuberculosis to reduce AIDS-related mortality in hospitalised patients in Africa (STAMP) trial, which recruited unselected (ie, irrespective of clinical presentation) adult (aged ≥18 years) patients with HIV-1 at admission to medical wards. Patients were included in our observational cohort study if they were enrolled at the Malawi site (Zomba Central Hospital) and were taking ART for at least 6 months at admission. Patients who met inclusion criteria had frozen plasma samples tested for HIV-1 viral load. Those with HIV-1 RNA of at least 1000 copies per mL had drug resistance testing by ultra-deep sequencing, with drug resistance defined as intermediate or high-level resistance using the Stanford HIVDR program. Mortality risk was calculated 56 days from enrolment. Patients were censored at death, at 56 days, or at last contact if lost to follow-up. The modelling strategy addressed the causal association between HIV multidrug resistance and mortality, excluding factors on the causal pathway (most notably, CD4 cell count, clinical signs of advanced HIV, and poor functional and nutritional status). FINDINGS: Of 1316 patients with HIV enrolled in the STAMP trial at the Malawi site between Oct 26, 2015, and Sept 19, 2017, 786 had taken ART for at least 6 months. 252 (32\%) of 786 patients had virological failure (viral load ≥1000 copies per mL). Mean age was 41·5 years (SD 11·4) and 528 (67\%) of 786 were women. Of 237 patients with HIV drug resistance results available, 195 (82\%) had resistance to lamivudine, 128 (54\%) to tenofovir, and 219 (92\%) to efavirenz. Resistance to at least two drugs was common (196, 83\%), and this was associated with increased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1·7, 95\% CI 1·2-2·4; p=0·0042). INTERPRETATION: Interventions are urgently needed and should target ART clinic, hospital, and post-hospital care, including differentiated care focusing on patients with advanced HIV, rapid viral load testing, and routine access to drug resistance testing. Prompt diagnosis and switching to alternative ART could reduce early mortality among inpatients with HIV.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple blood transcriptional signatures have been proposed for identification of active and incipient tuberculosis. We aimed to compare the performance of systematically identified candidate signatures for incipient tuberculosis and to benchmark these against WHO targets. METHODS: We did a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. We searched Medline and Embase for candidate whole blood mRNA signatures discovered with the primary objective of diagnosis of active or incipient tuberculosis, compared with controls who were healthy or had latent tuberculosis infection. We tested the performance of eligible signatures in whole blood transcriptomic datasets, in which sampling before tuberculosis diagnosis was done and time to disease was available. Culture-confirmed and clinically or radiologically diagnosed pulmonary or extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases were included. Non-progressor (individuals who remained tuberculosis-free during follow-up) samples with less than 6 months of follow-up from the date of sample collection were excluded, as were participants with prevalent tuberculosis and those who received preventive therapy. Scores were calculated for candidate signatures for each participant in the pooled dataset. Receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivities, and specificities were examined using prespecified intervals to tuberculosis ({$<$}3 months, {$<$}6 months, {$<$}1 year, and {$<$}2 years) from sample collection. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42019135618. RESULTS: We tested 17 candidate mRNA signatures in a pooled dataset from four eligible studies comprising 1126 samples. This dataset included 183 samples from 127 incipient tuberculosis cases in South Africa, Ethiopia, The Gambia, and the UK. Eight signatures (comprising 1-25 transcripts) that predominantly reflect interferon and tumour necrosis factor-inducible gene expression, had equivalent diagnostic accuracy for incipient tuberculosis over a 2-year period with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranging from 0·70 (95\% CI 0·64-0·76) to 0·77 (0·71-0·82). The sensitivity of all eight signatures declined with increasing disease-free time interval. Using a threshold derived from two SDs above the mean of uninfected controls to prioritise specificity and positive-predictive value, the eight signatures achieved sensitivities of 24·7-39·9\% over 24 months and of 47·1-81·0\% over 3 months, with corresponding specificities of more than 90\%. Based on pre-test probability of 2\%, the eight signatures achieved positive-predictive values ranging from 6·8-9·4\% over 24 months and 11·2-14·4\% over 3 months. When using biomarker thresholds maximising sensitivity and specificity with equal weighting to both, no signature met the minimum WHO target product profile parameters for incipient tuberculosis biomarkers over a 2-year period. INTERPRETATION: Blood transcriptional biomarkers reflect short-term risk of tuberculosis and only exceed WHO benchmarks if applied to 3-6-month intervals. Serial testing among carefully selected target groups might be required for optimal implementation of these biomarkers. FUNDING: Wellcome Trust and National Institute for Health Research.},

  abstract = {The risk of tuberculosis (TB) is variable among individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (LTBI), but validated estimates of personalized risk are lacking. In pooled data from 18 systematically identified cohort studies from 20 countries, including 80,468 individuals tested for LTBI, 5-year cumulative incident TB risk among people with untreated LTBI was 15.6\% (95\%\,confidence interval (CI), 8.0–29.2\%) among child contacts, 4.8\% (95\% CI, 3.0–7.7\%) among adult contacts, 5.0\% (95\% CI, 1.6–14.5\%) among migrants and 4.8\% (95\% CI, 1.5–14.3\%) among immunocompromised groups. We confirmed highly variable estimates within risk groups, necessitating an individualized approach to risk stratification. Therefore, we developed a personalized risk predictor for incident TB (PERISKOPE-TB) that combines a quantitative measure of T cell sensitization and clinical covariates. Internal–external cross-validation of the model demonstrated a random effects meta-analysis C-statistic of 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.82–0.93) for incident TB. In decision curve analysis, the model demonstrated clinical utility for targeting preventative treatment, compared to treating all, or no, people with LTBI. We challenge the current crude approach to TB risk estimation among people with LTBI in favor of our evidence-based and patient-centered method, in settings aiming for pre-elimination worldwide. The risk of developing active tuberculosis (TB) in individuals with latent TB infection is highly variable within and among different risk groups. A personalized risk predictor was developed to better target preventative treatment to individuals at greatest risk, supporting evidence-based clinical decision-making for latent TB.},

METHODS: Multi-stage sampling was used to select a sample of households whose members were evaluated for presence of signs and/or symptoms of active tuberculosis; history of tuberculosis treatment; and relevant demographic, socioeconomic, and household environment characteristics. Patients with suspected tuberculosis underwent standardized evaluation for active disease. FINDINGS: A sample of 263 households with 1142 individuals was evaluated. Nineteen people were classified as having had tuberculosis during the one-year reference period (May 2001-April 2002): nine (47\%) cases already had been diagnosed through the health care system, while 10 cases (53\%) were diagnosed through the survey. The prevalences for all forms of tuberculosis and for sputum smear-positive tuberculosis were 14.0 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 7.8-20.3) and 4.4 (CI = 0.83-7.89) per thousand, respectively. The incidences for all forms of tuberculosis and for sputum smear-positive tuberculosis were 9.2 (CI = 3.97-14.4) and 3.7 (CI = 0.39-6.95) per thousand per year, respectively. CONCLUSION: The rate of tuberculosis in this peri-urban community was exceptionally high and may be underestimated by current surveillance systems. The need for interventions aimed at reducing tuberculosis transmission in this, and other similar communities with high case rates, is urgent.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the observed gender difference is epidemiologically true or whether it is due to accessibility barriers for women. DESIGN: Two-stage random sampling population survey. People were interviewed by teams composed of one male and one female volunteer about the presence of symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis. One early morning sputum specimen of all thus identified tuberculosis suspects was examined by Ziehl-Neelsen technique. RESULTS: A total of 266189 people were surveyed, among whom 223 936 (84.1\%) could be interviewed. This led to the identification of 7001 tuberculosis suspects (2406 females and 4595 males) and 64 confirmed TB cases (16 females and 48 males). The female/male ratio (0.33:1) of cases found during the survey was not higher than that observed through routine diagnosis (0.42:1). The routine case-notification rate of sputum-positive cases during 2000 was about twice the rate observed during the survey (44.3 vs. 24.0 per 100 000 population). CONCLUSIONS: The gender difference observed in routine tuberculosis diagnosis is real, and is not due to lesser accessibility of women to the health services. The routine notification rate compares favourably with the detection of previously unknown cases found during the survey.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease of antiquity, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which principally affects the lungs. It is a major public-health problem, with around 9 million new cases and 2 million deaths estimated to occur each year. Patients with pulmonary TB whose sputum is smear-positive for M. tuberculosis form the main source of infection in communities. About 5\%-10\% of infected individuals are likely to develop symptomatic TB during their lives but the risk of developing the clinical manifestations of the disease is greatly increased by HIV co-infection. The strong association between HIV and TB in sub-Saharan Africa is responsible for the massive increase in the incidence of TB observed in that region in the last 20 years. Diagnosis of TB in resource-poor countries is largely based on sputum-smear microscopy and chest radiography, although these methods lack sensitivity or specificity, especially when used on HIV-infected patients. Effective treatment has existed for 40 years but TB-attributable mortality remains high among HIV-infected patients in Africa, who are also particularly likely to develop TB again after receiving drug treatment for the disease. In Eastern Europe it is drug resistance in the local M. tuberculosis that makes the treatment of TB relatively ineffective. The approach to TB control that is now internationally recommended is the DOTS ('directly-observed treatment, short-course') strategy, which aims to prevent the transmission of M. tuberculosis, and the related illness and death, by using combinations of anti-TB drugs to treat patients with the active disease. Unfortunately, countries in sub-Saharan Africa are falling short of the World Health Organization's targets for case detection and treatment. This failure is, in turn, making the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals for TB--to ensure that the incidence of TB is falling by 2015 and to halve the prevalence of TB and the annual number of TB-attributable deaths between 1990 and 2015--less likely. To improve the performance and impact of TB-control programmes, in the face of HIV co-infection and other constraints on DOTS, the World Health Organization has launched the revised 'Stop TB Strategy'. The new strategy, to be implemented via the Global Plan to Stop TB (2006-2015), includes intensified TB-case finding, treatment of latent TB infection with isoniazid, prevention of HIV infection, cotrimoxazole preventive therapy, and antiretroviral therapy.},

  abstract = {We undertook a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence-based software for identification of radiologic abnormalities (computer-aided detection, or CAD) compatible with pulmonary tuberculosis on chest x-rays (CXRs). We searched four databases for articles published between January 2005-February 2019. We summarized data on CAD type, study design, and diagnostic accuracy. We assessed risk of bias with QUADAS-2. We included 53 of the 4712 articles reviewed: 40 focused on CAD design methods (“Development” studies) and 13 focused on evaluation of CAD (“Clinical” studies). Meta-analyses were not performed due to methodological differences. Development studies were more likely to use CXR databases with greater potential for bias as compared to Clinical studies. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (median AUC [IQR]) were significantly higher: in Development studies AUC: 0.88 [0.82–0.90]) versus Clinical studies (0.75 [0.66–0.87]; p-value 0.004); and with deep-learning (0.91 [0.88–0.99]) versus machine-learning (0.82 [0.75–0.89]; p = 0.001). We conclude that CAD programs are promising, but the majority of work thus far has been on development rather than clinical evaluation. We provide concrete suggestions on what study design elements should be improved.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A universal testing and treatment strategy is a potential approach to reduce the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, yet previous trial results are inconsistent. METHODS: In the HPTN 071 (PopART) community-randomized trial conducted from 2013 through 2018, we randomly assigned 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa (total population, approximately 1 million) to group A (combination prevention intervention with universal antiretroviral therapy [ART]), group B (the prevention intervention with ART provided according to local guidelines [universal since 2016]), or group C (standard care). The prevention intervention included home-based HIV testing delivered by community workers, who also supported linkage to HIV care and ART adherence. The primary outcome, HIV incidence between months 12 and 36, was measured in a population cohort of approximately 2000 randomly sampled adults (18 to 44 years of age) per community. Viral suppression ({$<$}400 copies of HIV RNA per milliliter) was assessed in all HIV-positive participants at 24 months. RESULTS: The population cohort included 48,301 participants. Baseline HIV prevalence was 21\% or 22\% in each group. Between months 12 and 36, a total of 553 new HIV infections were observed during 39,702 person-years (1.4 per 100 person-years; women, 1.7; men, 0.8). The adjusted rate ratio for group A as compared with group C was 0.93 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 1.18; P\,=\,0.51) and for group B as compared with group C was 0.70 (95\% CI, 0.55 to 0.88; P\,=\,0.006). The percentage of HIV-positive participants with viral suppression at 24 months was 71.9\% in group A, 67.5\% in group B, and 60.2\% in group C. The estimated percentage of HIV-positive adults in the community who were receiving ART at 36 months was 81\% in group A and 80\% in group B. CONCLUSIONS: A combination prevention intervention with ART provided according to local guidelines resulted in a 30\% lower incidence of HIV infection than standard care. The lack of effect with universal ART was unanticipated and not consistent with the data on viral suppression. In this trial setting, universal testing and treatment reduced the population-level incidence of HIV infection.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Many treatments are adopted into clinical practice without a solid evidence base and might be used heterogeneously across settings. Rigorous randomised controlled trials are therefore needed to inform decisions about the comparative effectiveness of treatments in common use. The mainstay of comparative effectiveness research is pragmatic trial design, which emphasises broad eligibility criteria, simple logistics, routinely collected outcome data, and cost efficient designs. Although treatment differences at the individual level might be small, they can become important when aggregated across large populations. To detect these small differences, very large trials are often required. In multiple period, cluster randomised, crossover trials, the study design randomises clusters (eg, hospitals) to exposure to different interventions in a randomly determined order, and is an attractive design for comparative effectiveness research. The trial design can be highly statistically efficient, compared with other competing designs, and can have many logistical advantages. Several prominent examples of this trial design have been published recently, yet practical guidance is lacking on how best to design these trials to ensure that they provide robust evidence. Some considerations include how to determine the frequency and number of crossovers, the importance of a time balanced design, how to determine the required sample size, and how to analyse appropriately. The justification for using this design (over a design randomising on the level of individual patients) also raises ethical concerns when used to evaluate individual level interventions without the prospective informed consent of individual participants. In this article, we outline the key methodological and ethical requirements needed for the robust design of multiple period, cluster randomised, crossover trials.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Methods Cross-sectional survey conducted from September 2006 to July 2007. All inhabitants aged {$>$}15years were invited for screening for cough, history of tuberculosis (TB) treatment and chest X-ray (CXR) examination. TB suspects, defined as any survey participant with CXR abnormalities consistent with TB, or productive cough for more than 2weeks or TB treatment either currently or in the preceding 2years submitted sputum specimens for smear examination and culture and provided information on health-seeking behaviour in an in-depth interview. Results Of 94179 persons participating in the survey, 4.6\% had prolonged productive cough. Forty-four percentage of those had sought health care and reported pharmacies (35\%), commune health posts (29\%), public hospitals (24\%) and private physicians (10\%) as first point of contact. Only 7\% had undergone sputum smear examination. Of TB suspects with prolonged productive cough, 2.9\% were diagnosed with TB; 10.2\% of these reported smear and 21.9\% reported X-ray examination when visiting a health care facility. The average patient delay was 4.1weeks (95\% CI: 3.9-4.4) among cough suspects and 4.0weeks (95\% CI: 3.1-4.9) among TB cases. Conclusions In this Vietnamese survey, nearly half of persons with cough for more than 2weeks had visited a health care provider. The commonest first health facility contacted was the pharmacy. Sputum smears were rarely examined, except in the provincial TB hospital. Our findings highlight the need to improve diagnostic practices by retraining health staff on the performance of sputum examination for TB suspects. 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

METHOD: To assess the prevalence of TB in Viet Nam, a nationwide stratified cluster sample survey was conducted from 2006 to 2007. Nine household characteristics used in the second Viet Nam Living Standards Survey (VLSS) were scored per household. In the VLSS dataset, we regressed these nine characteristics against household expenditure per capita, and used the coefficients to predict household expenditure level (in quintiles) in our survey and assess its relation with TB prevalence. RESULTS: The prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed TB was 307 per 100,000 population in persons aged {$>$}/= 15 years (95\%CI 249-366). After adjustment for confounders, prevalence was found to be associated with household expenditure level: the rate was 2.5 times higher for those in the lowest household expenditure quintile (95\%CI 1.6-3.9) than those in the highest quintile. CONCLUSION: With a set of nine household characteristics, we were able to predict household expenditure level fairly accurately. There was a significant association between TB prevalence rates and estimated household expenditure level, showing that TB is related to poverty in Viet Nam.},

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey with multistage cluster sampling, stratified by urban, rural and remote areas, was done in 2006-2007 in 70 communes. All inhabitants aged {$>$} or = 15 years were invited for cough and chest X-ray examination. Participants with findings suggestive of tuberculosis provided sputum specimens for smear examination and culture. Point prevalence estimates, 95\% confidence intervals and design effects were calculated. Confidence intervals and P-values were adjusted for the cluster design. FINDINGS: Of 114,389 adult inhabitants, 94 179 (82.3\%) were screened. Of 87,314 (92.7\%) screened by both questionnaire and chest X-ray, 3522 (4.0\%) had productive cough, 518 (0.6\%) had a recent history of tuberculosis and 2972 (3.4\%) had chest X-ray abnormalities suggestive of tuberculosis. Sputum tests were done for 7648 participants. Sputum test, bacterial culture or both confirmed 269 tuberculosis cases, 174 of which were smear-positive. The prevalence rate of smear-positive tuberculosis was 145 per 100,000 (95\% confidence interval: 110-180) assuming no tuberculosis in persons aged {$<$} 15 years. Prevalence was 5.1 times as high in men as in women, increased with age, was higher in rural than in urban or remote areas and showed a north-to-south gradient. CONCLUSION: In Viet Nam, the tuberculosis prevalence rate based on positive sputum smear tests was 1.6 times as high as previously estimated. Age and sex patterns were consistent with notification data. Tuberculosis control should remain a high priority in Viet Nam.},

Based on the effect of ART on survival of HIV-infected people and HIV transmission, the age composition of the HIV epidemic in the region is expected to change in the coming decades. We quantify the change in the age composition of HIV-infected people in all countries in SSA. METHODS: We used STDSIM, a stochastic microsimulation model, and developed an approach to represent HIV prevalence and treatment coverage in 43 countries in SSA, using publicly available data. We predict future trends in HIV prevalence and total number of HIV-infected people aged 15-49 years and 50 years or older for different ART coverage levels. RESULTS: We show that, if treatment coverage continues to increase at present rates, the total number of HIV-infected people aged 50 years or older will nearly triple over the coming years: from 3.1 million in 2011 to 9.1 million in 2040, dramatically changing the age composition of the HIV epidemic in SSA. In 2011, about one in seven HIV-infected people was aged 50 years or older; in 2040, this ratio will be larger than one in four. CONCLUSION: The HIV epidemic in SSA is rapidly ageing, implying changing needs and demands in many social sectors, including health, social care, and old-age pension systems. Health policymakers need to anticipate the impact of the changing HIV age composition in their planning for future capacity in these systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) case notification rates are usually higher in men than in women, but notification data are insufficient to measure sex differences in disease burden. This review set out to systematically investigate whether sex ratios in case notifications reflect differences in disease prevalence and to identify gaps in access to and/or utilisation of diagnostic services. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In accordance with the published protocol (CRD42015022163), TB prevalence surveys in nationally representative and sub-national adult populations (age ≥ 15 y) in low- and middle-income countries published between 1 January 1993 and 15 March 2016 were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; review of abstracts; and correspondence with the World Health Organization. Random-effects meta-analyses examined male-to-female (M:F) ratios in TB prevalence and prevalence-to-notification (P:N) ratios for smear-positive TB. Meta-regression was done to identify factors associated with higher M:F ratios in prevalence and higher P:N ratios. Eighty-three publications describing 88 surveys with over 3.1 million participants in 28 countries were identified (36 surveys in Africa, three in the Americas, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 in South-East Asia and 17 in the Western Pacific). Fifty-six surveys reported in 53 publications were included in quantitative analyses. Overall random-effects weighted M:F prevalence ratios were 2.21 (95\% CI 1.92-2.54; 56 surveys) for bacteriologically positive TB and 2.51 (95\% CI 2.07-3.04; 40 surveys) for smear-positive TB. M:F prevalence ratios were highest in South-East Asia and in surveys that did not require self-report of signs/symptoms in initial screening procedures. The summary random-effects weighted M:F ratio for P:N ratios was 1.55 (95\% CI 1.25-1.91; 34 surveys). We intended to stratify the analyses by age, HIV status, and rural or urban setting; however, few studies reported such data. CONCLUSIONS: TB prevalence is significantly higher among men than women in low- and middle-income countries, with strong evidence that men are disadvantaged in seeking and/or accessing TB care in many settings. Global strategies and national TB programmes should recognise men as an underserved high-risk group and improve men's access to diagnostic and screening services to reduce the overall burden of TB more effectively and ensure gender equity in TB care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The existing estimate of the global burden of latent TB infection (LTBI) as "one-third" of the world population is nearly 20 y old. Given the importance of controlling LTBI as part of the End TB Strategy for eliminating TB by 2050, changes in demography and scientific understanding, and progress in TB control, it is important to re-assess the global burden of LTBI. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We constructed trends in annual risk in infection (ARI) for countries between 1934 and 2014 using a combination of direct estimates of ARI from LTBI surveys (131 surveys from 1950 to 2011) and indirect estimates of ARI calculated from World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates of smear positive TB prevalence from 1990 to 2014. Gaussian process regression was used to generate ARIs for country-years without data and to represent uncertainty. Estimated ARI time-series were applied to the demography in each country to calculate the number and proportions of individuals infected, recently infected (infected within 2 y), and recently infected with isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains. Resulting estimates were aggregated by WHO region. We estimated the contribution of existing infections to TB incidence in 2035 and 2050. In 2014, the global burden of LTBI was 23.0\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]: 20.4\%-26.4\%), amounting to approximately 1.7 billion people. WHO South-East Asia, Western-Pacific, and Africa regions had the highest prevalence and accounted for around 80\% of those with LTBI. Prevalence of recent infection was 0.8\% (95\% UI: 0.7\%-0.9\%) of the global population, amounting to 55.5 (95\% UI: 48.2-63.8) million individuals currently at high risk of TB disease, of which 10.9\% (95\% UI:10.2\%-11.8\%) was isoniazid-resistant. Current LTBI alone, assuming no additional infections from 2015 onwards, would be expected to generate TB incidences in the region of 16.5 per 100,000 per year in 2035 and 8.3 per 100,000 per year in 2050. Limitations included the quantity and methodological heterogeneity of direct ARI data, and limited evidence to inform on potential clearance of LTBI. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) globally in 2014, just under a quarter of the global population. Investment in new tools to improve diagnosis and treatment of those with LTBI at risk of progressing to disease is urgently needed to address this latent reservoir if the 2050 target of eliminating TB is to be reached.},

METHODS: Data from the surveillance system in the period 1990-2003 were analysed to assess trends of notification rates and the mean ages of notified cases. Data from repeated tuberculin surveys in the period 1986-2002 were estimated to assess the prevalence of TB infection, the annual risk of infection and its trend using various cut-off points in those with and without bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) scar. RESULTS: Age-standardised notification rates in the period 1996-2003 declined significantly, by 2.6\% to 5.9\% per year, in five provinces. However, in four provinces notification rates in the age group 15-24 years increased significantly, by 4.5\% to 13.6\% per year, during this period. The mean age of newly diagnosed patients with smear-positive TB increased up to 1995 but decreased thereafter. The annual risk of TB infection showed a significant annual decrease (4.9\% per year) in one province in surveys performed between 1986 and 1997, and in two provinces (6.6\% and 4.7\%) in surveys conducted between 1993 and 2002. CONCLUSION: These data suggest limited impact to date of the DOTS strategy in Vietnam. 2006 The Union.},

There is also a need to consolidate and update existing guidelines and promote their use in a user friendly manner. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement is an attempt to consolidate and update previous health economic evaluation guidelines efforts into one current, useful reporting guidance. The primary audiences for the CHEERS statement are researchers reporting economic evaluations and the editors and peer reviewers assessing them for publication. The need for new reporting guidance was identified by a survey of medical editors. A list of possible items based on a systematic review was created. A two round, modified Delphi panel consisting of representatives from academia, clinical practice, industry, government, and the editorial community was conducted. Out of 44 candidate items, 24 items and accompanying recommendations were developed. The recommendations are contained in a user friendly, 24 item checklist. A copy of the statement, accompanying checklist, and this report can be found on the ISPOR Health Economic Evaluations Publication Guidelines Task Force website (www.ispor.org/TaskForces/EconomicPubGuidelines.asp). We hope CHEERS will lead to better reporting, and ultimately, better health decisions. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the CHEERS statement is being co-published across 10 health economics and medical journals. We encourage other journals and groups, to endorse CHEERS. The author team plans to review the checklist for an update in five years.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Active case finding (ACF) of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is a key intervention to find the 30\% of people missed every year. However, ACF requires screening large numbers of individuals who have a low probability of positive results, typically {$<$}5\%, which makes using the recommended molecular tests expensive. METHODS: We conducted two ACF surveys (in 2020 and 2021) in high TB burden areas of Lao PDR. Participants were screened for TB symptoms and received a chest X-ray. Sputum samples of four consecutive individuals were pooled and tested with Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)/rifampicin (RIF) (Xpert-MTB/RIF) (2020) or Xpert-Ultra (2021). The agreement of the individual and pooled samples was compared and the reasons for discrepant results and potential cartridge savings were assessed. RESULTS: Each survey included 436 participants, which were tested in 109 pools. In the Xpert-MTB/RIF survey, 25 (sensitivity 89\%, 95\%\,CI 72.8\% to 96.3\%) of 28 pools containing MTB-positive samples tested positive and 81 pools containing only MTB-negative samples tested negative (specificity 100\%, 95\%\,CI 95.5\% to 100\%). In the Xpert-Ultra survey, all 32 (sensitivity 100\%, 95\%\,CI 89.3\% to 100\%) pools containing MTB-positive samples tested positive and all 77 (specificity 100\%, 95\%\,CI 95.3\% to 100\%) containing only MTB-negative samples tested negative. Pooling with Xpert-MTB/RIF and Xpert-Ultra saved 52\% and 46\% (227/436 and 199/436, respectively) of cartridge costs alone. CONCLUSION: Testing single and pooled specimens had a high level of agreement, with complete concordance when using Xpert-Ultra. Pooling samples could generate significant cartridge savings during ACF campaigns.},

Methods               We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Primary outcomes in Part A were reduction in Cryptosporidium shedding, safety, and PK. Primary analysis was according to protocol (ATP). Part B of the study compared CFZ PK in matched HIV-infected individuals without cryptosporidiosis.                                         Results               Twenty Part A and 10 Part B participants completed the study ATP. Almost all Part A participants had high viral loads and low CD4 counts, consistent with failure of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy. At study entry, the Part A CFZ group had higher Cryptosporidium shedding, total stool weight, and more diarrheal episodes compared to the placebo group. Over the inpatient period, compared to those who received placebo, the CFZ group Cryptosporidium shedding increased by 2.17 log2Cryptosporidium per gram stool (95\% upper confidence limit: 3.82), total stool weight decreased by 45.3 g (p=0.37), and number of diarrheal episodes increased by 2.32 (p=0.87). The most frequent solicited adverse effects were diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malaise. Three CFZ and 1 placebo subjects died during the study. Plasma levels of CFZ in participants with cryptosporidiosis were 2-fold lower than Part B controls.                                         Conclusion               Our findings do not support the efficacy of CFZ for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in a severely immunocompromised HIV population. However, this trial demonstrates a pathway to assess the therapeutic potential of drugs for cryptosporidiosis treatment. Screening persons with HIV for diarrhea, and especially Cryptosporidium infection, may identify those failing ARV therapy.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of Stepping Stones, a HIV prevention programme, on incidence of HIV and herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) and sexual behaviour. DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 70 villages (clusters) in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. PARTICIPANTS: 1360 men and 1416 women aged 15-26 years, who were mostly attending schools. INTERVENTION: Stepping Stones, a 50 hour programme, aims to improve sexual health by using participatory learning approaches to build knowledge, risk awareness, and communication skills and to stimulate critical reflection. Villages were randomised to receive either this or a three hour intervention on HIV and safer sex. Interviewers administered questionnaires at baseline and 12 and 24 months and blood was tested for HIV and HSV-2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: incidence of HIV. Other outcomes: incidence of HSV-2, unwanted pregnancy, reported sexual practices, depression, and substance misuse. RESULTS: There was no evidence that Stepping Stones lowered the incidence of HIV (adjusted incidence rate ratio 0.95, 95\% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.35). The programme was associated with a reduction of about 33\% in the incidence of HSV-2 (0.67, 0.46 to 0.97; P=0.036)-that is, Stepping Stones reduced the number of new HSV-2 infections over a two year period by 34.9 (1.6 to 68.2) per 1000 people exposed. Stepping Stones significantly improved a number of reported risk behaviours in men, with a lower proportion of men reporting perpetration of intimate partner violence across two years of follow-up and less transactional sex and problem drinking at 12 months. In women desired behaviour changes were not reported and those in the Stepping Stones programme reported more transactional sex at 12 months. CONCLUSION: Stepping Stones did not reduce incidence of HIV but had an impact on several risk factors for HIV-notably, HSV-2 and perpetration of intimate partner violence.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many southern African countries are nearing the global goal of diagnosing 90\% of people with HIV by 2020. In 2016, 84 and 86\% of people with HIV knew their status in Malawi and Zimbabwe, respectively. However, gaps remain, particularly among men. We investigated awareness and use of, and willingness to self-test for HIV and explored sociodemographic associations before large-scale implementation. METHODS: We pooled responses from two of the first cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys to include HIV self-testing (HIVST) questions in Malawi and Zimbabwe in 2015-16. We investigated sociodemographic factors and sexual risk behaviours associated with previously testing for HIV, and past use, awareness of, and future willingness to self-test using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for the sample design and limiting analysis to participants with a completed questionnaire and valid HIV test result. We restricted analysis of willingness to self-test to Zimbabwean men, as women and Malawians were not systematically asked this question. RESULTS: Of 31,385 individuals, 31.2\% of men had never tested compared with 16.5\% of women (p~{$<$}\,0.001). For men, the likelihood of having ever tested increased with age. Past use and awareness of HIVST was very low, 1.2 and 12.6\%, respectively. Awareness was lower among women than men (9.1\% vs 15.3\%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\,=\,1.55; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.75), and at younger ages, and lower education and literacy levels. Willingness to self-test among Zimbabwean men was high (84.5\%), with greater willingness associated with having previously tested for HIV, being at high sexual risk (highest willingness [aOR\,=\,3.74; 95\%CI: 1.39-10.03, p~{$<$}\,0.009]), and being ≥25\,years old. Wealthier men had greater awareness of HIVST than poorer men (p~{$<$}\,0.001). The highest willingness to self-test (aOR\,=\,3.74; 95\%CI: 1.39-10.03, p~{$<$}\,0.009) was among men at high HIV-related sexual risk. CONCLUSIONS: In 2015-16, many Malawian and Zimbabwean men had never tested for HIV. Despite low awareness and minimal HIVST experience, willingness to self-test was high among Zimbabwean men, especially older men with moderate-to-high HIV-related sexual risk. These data provide a valuable baseline against which to investigate population-level uptake of HIVST as programmes scale up. Programmes introducing, or planning to introduce, HIVST should consider including relevant questions in population-based surveys.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nomadic populations are often isolated and have difficulty accessing health care, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Although Nigeria has one of the highest tuberculosis (TB) burdens in Africa, case detection rates remain relatively low. METHODS: Active case finding for TB among nomadic populations was implemented over a 2-year period in Adamawa State. A total of 378 community screening days were organised with local leaders; community volunteers provided treatment support. Xpert(®) MTB/RIF was available for nomads with negative smear results. RESULTS: Through active case finding, 96\,376 nomads were verbally screened, yielding 1310 bacteriologically positive patients. The number of patients submitting sputum for smear microscopy statewide increased by 112\% compared with the 2 years before the intervention. New smear-positive notifications increased by 49.5\%, while notifications of all forms of TB increased by 24.5\% compared with expected notifications based on historical trends. Nomads accounted for respectively 31.4\% and 26.0\% of all smear-positive and all forms TB notifications. Pre-treatment loss to follow-up and treatment outcomes were similar among nomads and non-nomads. DISCUSSION: Nomads in Nigeria have high TB rates, and active case-finding approaches may be useful in identifying and successfully treating them. Large-scale interventions in vulnerable populations can improve TB case detection.},

In the context of a randomised trial looking at the impact of novel diagnostics such as computer-aided chest x-ray diagnosis (CAD4TB), we aimed to investigate the costs incurred by patients seeking TB diagnosis and whether optimised diagnostic interventions could result in a reduction in the cost faced by households.                                                          Methods:                              PROSPECT was a three-arm randomised trial conducted in a public primary health clinic in Blantyre, Malawi during 2018-2019 (trial arms: standard of care [SOC]; HIV testing [HIV]; HIV testing and CAD4TB [HIV/TB]). The direct and indirect costs incurred by 219 PROSPECT participants over the 56-day follow-up period were collected. Costs were deemed catastrophic if they exceeded 20\% of annual household income. We compared mean costs and used generalised linear regression models to examine whether the interventions could result in a reduction in total costs.                                                          Results:                                             The mean total cost incurred by all 219 participants was US\$12.11 (standard error (SE): 1.86). The indirect and direct cost was US\$8.47 (SE: 1.66) and US\$3.64 (SE: 0.38), respectively. The mean total cost composed of 5.6\% of the average annual household income. In total, 5\% (9/180) of the participants with complete income data incurred catastrophic costs. Compared to SOC, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean total cost faced by those in the HIV (ratio: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.51, 1.19) and HIV/TB arms (ratio: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.53, 1.37).                                                          Conclusions:                                             Despite the absence of user fees, patients seeking healthcare with TB symptoms incurred catastrophic costs. The optimised TB diagnostic interventions that were investigated in the PROSPECT study did not significantly reduce costs. TB diagnosis interventions should be implemented alongside social protection policies whilst ensuring healthcare facilities are accessible by the poor.},

OBJECTIVE : To determine the prevalence of pulmonary TB among the general adult population aged {$>$}15 years in 2010-2011. METHOD: A nationwide, cluster-sampled, stratified (urban/rural/pastoralist), cross-sectional survey was conducted in 85 selected clusters. All consenting participants were screened for TB using: 1) chest X-ray (CXR) and 2) an interview to screen for symptoms suggestive of TB disease. RESULT: Of 51 667 eligible individuals, 46 697 (90\%) participated in the survey and completed at least the screening interview. CXR was performed among 46 548 (99.7\%) participants. A total of 6080 (13\%) participants were eligible for sputum examination. From the survey, it was estimated that in the national adult population 1) the prevalence of smear-positive TB was 108/100 000 (95\%CI 73-143), and 2) that of bacteriologically confirmed TB was 277/100 000 (95\%CI 208-347). CONCLUSION: We found that the TB burden was lower than previously thought, which may indicate better programme performance. However, a high proportion of TB among young persons suggests that TB is circulating in the community and that there is a need for more efforts to limit the spread of TB disease. 2014 The Union.},

We estimated measles susceptibility of a cohort of children born in Liverpool between 1995 and 2012 to understand whether there was a change in susceptibility before and after the outbreak and to inform vaccination strategy. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The city of Liverpool, North West UK. PARTICIPANTS: All children born in Liverpool (72\hspace{0.25em}101) between 1995 and 2012 inclusive who were identified using the Child Health Information System (CHIS) and were still resident within Liverpool in 2014. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated cohort age-disaggregated and neighbourhood-disaggregated measles susceptibility according to WHO thresholds before and after the outbreak for children aged 1-17\hspace{0.25em}years. RESULTS: Susceptibility to measles was above WHO elimination thresholds before and after the measles outbreak in the 10+ age group. The proportion of children susceptible before and after outbreak, respectively: age 1-4\hspace{0.25em}years 15.0\% before and 14.9\% after; age 5-9\hspace{0.25em}years 9.9\% before and 7.7\% after; age 10+ years 8.6\% before and 8.5\% after. Despite an intensive MMR immunisation catch-up campaign after the 2012-2013 measles outbreak, the overall proportion of children with no MMR remains high at 6.1\% (4390/72\hspace{0.25em}351). Across all age groups and before and after the outbreak, measles susceptibility was clustered by neighbourhood, with deprived areas having the greatest proportion of susceptible children. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sustained measles outbreaks remains, especially as large pools of susceptible older children will start leaving secondary education and continue to aggregate in higher education, employment and other community settings and institutions resulting in the potential for a propagated measles outbreak.},

Literature on the clinical effects of DIR has not been systematically evaluated. We aimed to summarise the risk of mortality, AIDS and serious non-AIDS events associated with DIR with a systematic review. METHODS: The protocol is registered with the Centre for Review Dissemination, University of York (registration number CRD42014010821). Included studies investigated the effect of DIR on mortality, AIDS, or serious non-AIDS events in cohort studies or cohorts contained in arms of randomised controlled trials for adults aged 16 years or older. DIR was classified as a suboptimal CD4 count (as defined by the study) despite virological suppression following at least 6 months of ART. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to December 2015. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in cohort studies. Two authors applied inclusion criteria and one author extracted data. Risk ratios were calculated for each clinical outcome reported. RESULTS: Of 20 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 14 different definitions of DIR were used. Risk ratios for mortality in patients with and without DIR ranged between 1.00 (95\% CI 0.26 to 3.92) and 4.29 (95\% CI 1.96 to 9.38) with the majority of studies reporting a 2 to 3 fold increase in risk. CONCLUSIONS: DIR is associated with a marked increase in mortality in most studies but definitions vary widely. We propose a standardised definition to aid the development of management options for DIR.},

We used community-based TB testing with the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay ("Ultra") to characterize individuals with previously undiagnosed TB and compare them to those from the same community who were diagnosed with TB through routine care. METHODS: We offered community-based sputum Ultra testing to adult residents of a well-defined area (population 34 000 adults) in Kampala, Uganda, via door-to-door screening and venue-based testing, then used detailed interview and laboratory testing to characterize TB-positive individuals. We compared these individuals to residents diagnosed with pulmonary TB at local health facilities and a representative sample of residents without TB (controls). RESULTS: Of 12 032 residents with interpretable Ultra results, 113 (940 [95\% confidence interval \{CI\}, 780-1130] per 100 000) tested positive, including 71 (63\%) positive at the lowest (trace) level. A spectrum of TB disease was observed in terms of chronic cough (93\% among health facility-diagnosed cases, 77\% among residents with positive community-based Ultra results at levels above trace, 33\% among trace-positive community participants, and 18\% among TB-negative controls), TB symptom prevalence (99\%, 87\%, 60\%, and 38\%, respectively), and C-reactive protein (75th percentile: 101 mg/L, 28 mg/L, 6 mg/L, and 4 mg/L, respectively). Community-diagnosed cases were less likely than health facility-diagnosed cases to have human immunodeficiency virus coinfection or previous TB. The specificity of Ultra was 99.4\% (95\% CI, 99.2\%-99.5\%) relative to a single spot sputum culture. CONCLUSIONS: People with undiagnosed prevalent TB in the community have different characteristics than those diagnosed with pulmonary TB in health facilities.

Cross-reactions due to infection with environmental mycobacteria and/or bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination compromise the estimates derived from population-level tuberculin skin-test surveys using traditional cutoff methods. Newer statistical approaches are prone to failure of model convergence, especially in settings where the prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection is low and environmental sensitization is high. We conducted a tuberculin skin-test survey in 5,119 preschool children in the general population and among household contacts of tuberculosis cases in 2012-2014 in a district in northern Malawi where sensitization to environmental mycobacteria is common and almost all children are BCG-vaccinated. We compared different proposed methods of estimating M. tuberculosis prevalence, including a method described by Rust and Thomas more than 40 years ago. With the different methods, estimated prevalence in the general population was 0.7\%-11.5\% at ages {$<$}2 years and 0.8\%-3.3\% at ages 2-4 years. The Rust and Thomas method was the only method to give a lower estimate in the younger age group (0.7\% vs 0.8\%), suggesting that it was the only method that adjusted appropriately for the marked effect of BCG-attributable induration in the very young.},

METHOD: Prevalence of tuberculin skin test (TST) positivity was compared between contacts of index cases aged 2–10 years who were HIV-negative, HIV-positive but not on ART, on ART for {$<$}1 year and on ART for ⩾1 year. Random-effects logistic regression was used to take into account clustering within households.

The odds were 2.9 times higher in child contacts of HIV-negative index cases (aOR 2.9, 95\%CI 1.0–8.2).

The patients were classified as TB suspected and TB positive cases which were divided into ten yearly different age groups. In infant group up to 10 years, the TB suspected cases were 9 to 10\% and positive TB patients were 2 to 6\% in both males and females. The percentages of TB positive and suspected patients were high in both males and females in age group of 11 -20 years ranging from 20 to 27\% which increased to the maximum of 33 to 37\%) in age group of 21-30 years and decreased thereafter, ranging between 10 to 20\% in age group of 31-40 years. In subsequent age groups of 41-50 and 51-60 years the number and percentages of patients decelerated from 7\% in age group of 41-50 years followed by elderly age groups of 61-70, 71-80 and 81-90 years. The total number of suspected and the positive patients during four years were: 1141 and 299 in males, and 740 and 175 in females. The percentages of positive TB patients out of the suspected ones over the years were: 26.20 in males and 23.64 in females. Of the total positive patients over four years, however, 61.29\% were males and 32.71\%) females. Thus the number and percentages of the TB patients were higher in males than the females. The results indicated that the TB disease was more prevalent in males than the females in and around Arba Minch town of south Ethiopia. The reasons for males being more affected with TB than females were not known. The greater mobility of males could possibly lead to getting higher infection by coming into contact with the TB patients and or the males were more prone to infection of this disease. However, it needs to be investigated for finding the reasons for more prevalence of TB in males than females.},

Using enhanced TB surveillance data, we recorded all TB treatment initiations and outcomes between 2015 and 2018. Household locations were geolocated, and distances were measured by a straight line or shortest road network. We constructed Bayesian multi-level logistic regression models to investigate associations between distance and case fatality. A total of 479/4397 (10.9\%) TB patients died. Greater distance was associated with higher (odds ratio (OR) 1.07 per kilometre (km) increase, 95\% credible interval (CI) 0.99–1.16) odds of death in TB patients registered at the referral hospital, but not among TB patients registered at primary clinics (OR 0.98 per km increase, 95\% CI 0.92–1.03). Age (OR 1.02 per year increase, 95\% CI 1.01–1.02) and HIV-positive status (OR 2.21, 95\% CI 1.73–2.85) were also associated with higher odds of death. Model estimates were similar for both distance measures. Distance was a risk factor for death among patients at the main referral hospital, likely due to delayed diagnosis and suboptimal healthcare access. To reduce mortality, targeted community TB screening interventions for TB disease and HIV, and expansion of novel sensitive diagnostic tests are required.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As infectious diseases approach global elimination targets, spatial targeting is increasingly important to identify community hotspots of transmission and effectively target interventions. We aimed to synthesise relevant evidence to define best practice approaches and identify policy and research gaps. OBJECTIVE: To systematically appraise evidence for the effectiveness of spatially targeted community public health interventions for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), leprosy and malaria. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, Web of Science and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between 1 January 1993 and 22 March 2021. STUDY SELECTION: The studies had to include HIV or TB or leprosy or malaria and spatial hotspot definition, and community interventions. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A data extraction tool was used. For each study, we summarised approaches to identifying hotpots, intervention design and effectiveness of the intervention. RESULTS: Ten studies, including one cluster randomised trial and nine with alternative designs (before-after, comparator area), satisfied our inclusion criteria. Spatially targeted interventions for HIV (one USA study), TB (three USA) and leprosy (two Brazil, one Federated States of Micronesia) each used household location and disease density to define hotspots followed by community-based screening. Malaria studies (one each from India, Indonesia and Kenya) used household location and disease density for hotspot identification followed by complex interventions typically combining community screening, larviciding of stagnant water bodies, indoor residual spraying and mass drug administration. Evidence of effect was mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Studies investigating spatially targeted interventions were few in number, and mostly underpowered or otherwise limited methodologically, affecting interpretation of intervention impact. Applying advanced epidemiological methodologies supporting more robust hotspot identification and larger or more intensive interventions would strengthen the evidence-base for this increasingly important approach.

  abstract = {Local information is needed to guide targeted interventions for respiratory infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Case notification rates (CNRs) are readily available, but systematically underestimate true disease burden in neighbourhoods with high diagnostic access barriers. We explored a novel approach, adjusting CNRs for under-notification (P:N ratio) using neighbourhood-level predictors of TB prevalence-to-notification ratios. We analysed data from 1) a citywide routine TB surveillance system including geolocation, confirmatory mycobacteriology, and clinical and demographic characteristics of all registering TB patients in Blantyre, Malawi during 2015–19, and 2) an adult TB prevalence survey done in 2019. In the prevalence survey, consenting adults from randomly selected households in 72 neighbourhoods had symptom-plus-chest X-ray screening, confirmed with sputum smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/Rif and culture. Bayesian multilevel models were used to estimate adjusted neighbourhood prevalence-to-notification ratios, based on summarised posterior draws from fitted adult bacteriologically-confirmed TB CNRs and prevalence. From 2015–19, adult bacteriologically-confirmed CNRs were 131 (479/371,834), 134 (539/415,226), 114 (519/463,707), 56 (283/517,860) and 46 (258/578,377) per 100,000 adults per annum, and 2019 bacteriologically-confirmed prevalence was 215 (29/13,490) per 100,000 adults. Lower educational achievement by household head and neighbourhood distance to TB clinic was negatively associated with CNRs. The mean neighbourhood P:N ratio was 4.49 (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 0.98–11.91), consistent with underdiagnosis of TB, and was most pronounced in informal peri-urban neighbourhoods. Here we have demonstrated a method for the identification of neighbourhoods with high levels of under-diagnosis of TB without the requirement for a prevalence survey; this is important since prevalence surveys are expensive and logistically challenging. If confirmed, this approach may support more efficient and effective targeting of intensified TB and HIV case-finding interventions aiming to accelerate elimination of urban TB.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite progress towards the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 95-95-95 targets, South Africa is still suffering from one of the largest HIV epidemics globally. In this study, we generated high-resolution HIV prevalence maps and identified people living with HIV (PLHIV) in underserved areas to provide essential information for the optimal allocation of HIV-related services. METHODS: The data come from the South Africa Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2016 and spatial variables from other published literature. We produced high-resolution maps of HIV prevalence and underserved areas, defined as a greater than 30 min travel time to the nearest healthcare facility. Using these maps and the population density, we mapped PLHIV and the PLHIV within underserved areas for 30, 60 and 120 min thresholds. RESULTS: There was substantial geographic variation in HIV prevalence, ranging from 1.4\% to 24.2\%, with a median of 11.5\% for men, and from 2.1\% to 48.1\%, with a median of 20.6\% for women. Gauteng province showed the highest density for both HIV prevalence and PLHIV. 80\% of all areas in the country were identified as underserved areas (30 min threshold), which contained more than 16\% and 20\% of the total men and women living with HIV, respectively. KwaZulu-Natal province had the largest number of PLHIV in underserved areas (30 min threshold) and showed less than one healthcare facility per 1000 PLHIV. CONCLUSION: Our study showed extensive spatial variation of HIV prevalence and significant numbers of PLHIV in underserved areas in South Africa. Moreover, we identified locations where HIV-related services need to be intensified to reach the \textasciitilde 1.5\,million PLHIV in underserved areas, particularly in KwaZulu-Natal province, with less than one healthcare facility per 1000 PLHIV.},

Explanatory factors may include weather, indoor crowding, seasonal respiratory infections and migration. Using enhanced citywide TB surveillance data collected over nine years in Blantyre, Malawi, we set out to investigate how weather and seasonality affect temporal trends in TB case notification rates (CNRs) across different demographic groups. We used data from prospective enhanced surveillance between April 2011 and December 2018, which systematically collected age, HIV status, sex and case notification dates for all registering TB cases in Blantyre. We retrieved temperature and rainfall data from the Global Surface Summary of the Day weather station database. We calculated weekly trends in TB CNRs, rainfall and temperature, and calculated 10-week moving averages. To investigate the associations between rainfall, temperature and TB CNRs, we fitted generalized linear models using a distributed lag nonlinear framework. The estimated Blantyre population increased from 1,068,151 in April 2011 to 1,264,304 in December 2018, with 15,908~TB cases recorded. Overall annual TB CNRs declined from 222 to 145 per 100,000 between 2012 and 2018, with the largest declines seen in HIV-positive people and adults aged over 20~years old. TB CNRs peaks occurred with increasing temperature in September and October before the onset of increased rainfall, and later in the rainy season during January-March, after sustained rainfall. When lag between a change in weather and TB case notifications was accounted for, higher average rainfall was associated with an equivalent six weeks of relatively lower TB notification rates, whereas there were no changes in TB CNR associated with change in average temperatures. TB CNRs in Blantyre have a seasonal pattern of two cyclical peaks per year, coinciding with the start and end of the rainy season. These trends may be explained by increased transmission at certain times of the year, by limited healthcare access, by patterns of seasonal respiratory infections precipitating cough and care-seeking, or by migratory patterns related to planting and harvesting during the rainy season.},

OBJECTIVE: To estimate trends in TB prevalence in a rural community with DOTS. DESIGN: Surveys of pulmonary tuberculosis were undertaken in representative samples of subjects aged {$>$} or =15 years (N = 83,000 - 92,000), initially and after two and half, five and seven and half years of implementation of DOTS. Sputa were collected from those with abnormal radiograph and/or presence of chest symptoms, and examined by direct smear and culture. RESULTS: The prevalence of culture-positive tuberculosis was 607, 454, 309 and 388 per 100,000 in the four surveys, and that of smear-positive tuberculosis was 326, 259, 168 and 180. In the first five years; annual decrease was 12.4\% (95\% CI 10.4 - 14.4\%) for culture-positive tuberculosis, and 12.2\% (95\% CI 8.0-16.2) for smear-positive tuberculosis. This was, however, followed by a significant increase in the next two and half years. The average new smear-positive case-notification rate was 75 per 100,000 during first four years but declined to 49 in subsequent years. There were no methodological differences during this period and information on changes in socio-economic indicators and nutritional standards was unavailable. CONCLUSION: Despite the average annual success rate (78\%) in this tuberculosis unit being lower than the expected rate of 85\%, the implementation of DOTS was followed by a substantial decrease in the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis over the seven and half year period. Our findings suggest that sustaining the high effectiveness of DOTS programme needs vigilant supervision.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Screening for tuberculosis (TB) disease aims to improve early TB case detection. The ultimate goal is to improve outcomes for people with TB and to reduce Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in the community through improved case detection, reduction in diagnostic delays and early treatment. Before screening programmes are recommended, evidence is needed of individual and/or community-level benefits. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess the evidence that screening for TB disease 1) initially increases the number of TB cases initiated on anti-tuberculosis treatment, 2) identifies cases earlier in the course of disease, 3) reduces mortality and morbidity, and 4) impacts on TB epidemiology. RESULTS: A total of 28\,798 publications were identified by the search strategy: 27\,087 were excluded on initial screening and 1749 on full text review, leaving 62 publications that addressed at least one of the study questions. Screening increases the number of cases found in the short term. In many settings, more than half of the prevalent TB cases in the community remain undiagnosed. Screening tends to find cases earlier and with less severe disease, but this may be attributed to case-finding studies using more sensitive diagnostic methods than routine programmes. Treatment outcomes among people identified through screening are similar to outcomes among those identified through passive case finding. Current studies provide insufficient evidence to show that active screening for TB disease impacts on TB epidemiology. CONCLUSION: Individual and community-level benefits from active screening for TB disease remain uncertain. So far, the benefits of earlier diagnosis on patient outcomes and transmission have not been established.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ratios of bacteriologically positive tuberculosis (TB) prevalence to notification rates are used to characterise typical durations of TB disease. However, this ignores the clinical spectrum of tuberculosis disease and potentially long infectious periods with minimal or no symptoms prior to care-seeking. METHODS: We developed novel statistical models to estimate progression from initial bacteriological positivity including smear conversion, symptom onset and initial care-seeking. Case-detection ratios, TB incidence, durations, and other parameters were estimated by fitting the model to tuberculosis prevalence survey and notification data (one subnational and 11 national datasets) within a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. RESULTS: Analysis across 11 national datasets found asymptomatic tuberculosis durations in the range 4-8\,months for African countries; three countries in Asia (Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Philippines) showed longer durations of {$>$}\,1\,year. For the six countries with relevant data, care-seeking typically began half-way between symptom onset and notification. For Kenya and Blantyre, Malawi, individual-level data were available. The sex-specific durations of asymptomatic bacteriologically-positive tuberculosis were 9.0\,months (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 7.2-11.2) for men and 8.1\,months (95\% CrI: 6.2-10.3) for women in Kenya, and 4.9\,months (95\% CrI: 2.6-7.9) for men and 3.5\,months (95\% CrI: 1.3-6.2) for women in Blantyre. Age-stratified analysis of data for Kenya showed no strong age-dependence in durations. For Blantyre, HIV-stratified analysis estimated an asymptomatic duration of 1.3\,months (95\% CrI: 0.3-3.0) for HIV-positive people, shorter than the 8.5\,months (95\% CrI: 5.0-12.7) for HIV-negative people. Additionally, case-detection ratios were higher for people living with HIV than HIV-negative people (93\% vs 71\%). CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic TB disease typically lasts around 6\,months. We found no evidence of age-dependence, but much shorter durations among people living with HIV, and longer durations in some Asian settings. To eradicate TB transmission, greater gains may be achieved by proactively screening people without symptoms through active case finding interventions.},

Over the past decade, the number of patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to the most effective drugs against tuberculosis (ie, rifampicin and isoniazid), which is called multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, has continued to increase. Globally, 4·6\% of patients with tuberculosis have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but in some areas, like Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Ukraine, this proportion exceeds 25\%. Treatment for patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is prolonged (ie, 9-24 months) and patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis have less favourable outcomes than those treated for drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Individualised multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment with novel (eg, bedaquiline) and repurposed (eg, linezolid, clofazimine, or meropenem) drugs and guided by genotypic and phenotypic drug susceptibility testing can improve treatment outcomes. Some clinical trials are evaluating 6-month regimens to simplify management and improve outcomes of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Here we review optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis and their contacts.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent. In many countries, national TB prevalence surveys are the only way to reliably measure the burden of TB disease and can also provide other evidence to inform national efforts to improve TB detection and treatment. Our objective was to synthesise the results and lessons learned from national surveys completed in Africa between 2008 and 2016, to complement a previous review for Asia. RESULTS: Twelve surveys completed in Africa were identified: Ethiopia (2010-2011), Gambia (2011-2013), Ghana (2013), Kenya (2015-2016), Malawi (2013-2014), Nigeria (2012), Rwanda (2012), Sudan (2013-2014), Tanzania (2011-2012), Uganda (2014-2015), Zambia (2013-2014) and Zimbabwe (2014). The eligible population in all surveys was people aged ≥15~years who met residency criteria. In total 588~105 individuals participated, equivalent to 82\% (range 57-96\%) of those eligible. The prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB disease in those ≥15~years varied from 119 (95\% CI 79-160) per 100~000 population in Rwanda and 638 (95\% CI 502-774) per 100~000 population in Zambia. The male:female ratio was 2.0 overall, ranging from 1.2 (Ethiopia) to 4.1 (Uganda). Prevalence per 100~000 population generally increased with age, but the absolute number of cases was usually highest among those aged 35-44~years. Of identified TB cases, 44\% (95\% CI 40-49) did not report TB symptoms during screening and were only identified as eligible for diagnostic testing due to an abnormal chest X-ray. The overall ratio of prevalence to case notifications was 2.5 (95\% CI 1.8-3.2) and was consistently higher for men than women. Many participants who did report TB symptoms had not sought care; those that had were more likely to seek care in a public health facility. HIV prevalence was systematically lower among prevalent cases than officially notified TB patients with an overall ratio of 0.5 (95\% CI 0.3-0.7). The two main study limitations were that none of the surveys included people {$<$}15~years, and 5 of 12 surveys did not have data on HIV status. CONCLUSIONS: National TB prevalence surveys implemented in Africa between 2010 and 2016 have contributed substantial new evidence about the burden of TB disease, its distribution by age and sex, and gaps in TB detection and treatment. Policies and practices to improve access to health services and reduce under-reporting of detected TB cases are needed, especially among men. All surveys provide a valuable baseline for future assessment of trends in TB disease burden.},

Such data are typically obtained through a national population and housing census. However, population estimates can quickly become inaccurate in localized areas, particularly where migration or displacement has occurred. Some conflict-affected and resource-poor countries have not conducted a census in over 10 y. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate population numbers in small areas based on enumeration data from sample areas and nationwide information about administrative boundaries, building locations, settlement types, and other factors related to population density. We demonstrated this model by estimating population sizes in every 10- m grid cell in Nigeria with national coverage. These gridded population estimates and areal population totals derived from them are accompanied by estimates of uncertainty based on Bayesian posterior probabilities. The model had an overall error rate of 67 people per hectare (mean of absolute residuals) or 43\% (using scaled residuals) for predictions in out-of-sample survey areas (approximately 3 ha each), with increased precision expected for aggregated population totals in larger areas. This statistical approach represents a significant step toward estimating populations at high resolution with national coverage in the absence of a complete and recent census, while also providing reliable estimates of uncertainty to support informed decision making.},

We used a random-effects model to calculate disease-specific relative risk (RR) meta-estimates. Household air pollution exposure was defined as use of polluting fuels (coal, wood, charcoal, agricultural wastes, animal dung, or kerosene) for household cooking or heating. Temporal trends in mortality and disease burden associated with household air pollution, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), were estimated from 2000 to 2017 using exposure prevalence data from 183 of 193 UN member states. 95\% CIs were estimated by propagating uncertainty from the RR meta-estimates, prevalence of household air pollution exposure, and disease-specific mortality and burden estimates using a simulation-based approach.

Objective: To assess community-based prevalence of undetected active pulmonary TB (PTB) in pastoralists of the Amibara District. Methods: Between March and April 2010, a community-based cross-sectional survey of undiagnosed active PTB was conducted in the pastoralists of the Amibara District of the Afar Region, north-east Ethiopia. The study participants were interviewed for symptoms suggestive of PTB using a structured questionnaire. Sputum samples were collected and processed for smear microscopy and culture. Mycobacterium genus typing was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Out of 222 individuals who had symptoms suggestive of PTB, 4 (1.8\%) were found positive by smear microscopy, while mycobacterial growth was observed on 62 (27.9\%) samples. Mycobacterium genus typing was carried out for 42 of these 62 samples; 39 (92.9\%) gave a positive signal for the genus Mycobacterium. Of these, 23 (59\%) isolates proved to be members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex, while the remaining 16 (41.0\%) were found to be members of non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) species. Conclusion: Sputum culture is highly sensitive, and it is the gold standard for the bacteriological diagnosis of PTB, while smear microscopy is less sensitive to detect acid fast bacilli (AFB) in stained sputum smears. The findings of the present study warrant the strengthening of culture facility services in the study area. The study also provides important preliminary information on the status of NTM infection in the pastoral setting. Nevertheless, further investigations into the species identification of the NTM infections would be useful in the study area. 2013 Asian-African Society for Mycobacteriology.},

  abstract = {In 2009 WHO reported a tuberculosis (TB) prevalence rate of 337 per 100,000 people and an incidence rate of 250 per 100,000 people for Papua New Guinea (PNG). This makes PNG to one of the high burden countries in the western Pacifc region. However, the current estimate of the TB prevalence in PNG comes exclusively from non-systematically collected records from hospitals and health facilities, and therefore only represents the number of cases that were diagnosed and received treatment. This is most likely a gross underestimation of the TB prevalence in the country. This study aims to establish a community-based case prevalence of TB around several health centres across the country to obtain an estimate of the true burden of TB in PNG. Active TB case detection surveys are being conducted in four sentinel sites across PNG which were established in the frame of the Global Fund Round 8 Malaria Grant. In each site, people aged 15 years or above are screened for chronic cough from whom sputum samples are being collected. All suspected samples are screened for Mycobacteria by microscopy, tested for drug susceptibility to assess prevalence of drug resistance and subsequently genotyped to identify the major M. tuberculosis lineages and circulating bacterial strains. A complementary sample collection strategy through passive case detection is conducted in three urban hospitals. At the frst two sites - Usino Bundi district (Madang) and Alotau district (Milne Bay)-, a total of 1736 households with 5038 members aged 15years or above were screened. A total of 164 people with chronic cough were identifed and their sputum analysed. Data on community prevalence, age and sex distribution of pulmonary tuberculosis infection as well as preliminary data on the prevalence of drug resistance and on prevalence of different Mycobacterium tuberculosis genotypes in the study areas will be presented.},

Options for including preventive efforts have not yet been fully considered. This paper presents a narrative review of the historical and recent progress in TB control and the role of TB risk factors and social determinants. The review was conducted with a view to assess the prospects of effectively controlling TB under the current strategy, and the potential to increase epidemiological impact through additional preventive interventions. The review suggests that, while the current strategy is effective in curing patients and saving lives, the epidemiological impact has so far been less than predicted. In order to reach long-term epidemiological targets for global TB control, additional interventions to reduce peoples' vulnerability for TB may therefore be required. Risk factors that seem to be of importance at the population level include poor living and working conditions associated with high risk of TB transmission, and factors that impair the host's defence against TB infection and disease, such as HIV infection, malnutrition, smoking, diabetes, alcohol abuse, and indoor air pollution. Preventive interventions may target these factors directly or via their underlying social determinants. The identification of risk groups also helps to target strategies for early detection of people in need of TB treatment. More research is needed on the suitability, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of these intervention options.},

Yet tuberculosis remains a severe global public health threat. There are more than 9 million new cases every year worldwide, and the incidence rate is falling at less than 1\% per year. Although the overall target related to the Millennium Development Goals of halting and beginning to reverse the epidemic might have already been reached in 2004, the more important long-term elimination target set for 2050 will not be met with present strategies and instruments. Several key challenges persist. Many vulnerable people do not have access to affordable services of sufficient quality. Technologies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are old and inadequate. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a serious threat in many settings. HIV/AIDS continues to fuel the tuberculosis epidemic, especially in Africa. Furthermore, other risk factors and underlying social determinants help to maintain tuberculosis in the community. Acceleration of the decline towards elimination of this disease will need invigorated actions in four broad areas: continued scale-up of early diagnosis and proper treatment for all forms of tuberculosis in line with the Stop TB Strategy; development and enforcement of bold health-system policies; establishment of links with the broader development agenda; and promotion and intensification of research towards innovations.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Linkage from HIV testing and counselling (HTC) to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is suboptimal in many national programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to delayed initiation of ART and increased risk of death. Reasons for failure of linkage are poorly understood. METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with health providers and HIV-positive primary care patients as part of a prospective cohort study at primary health centres in Blantyre, Malawi. Patients successful and unsuccessful in linking to ART were included. RESULTS: Progression through the HIV care pathway was strongly influenced by socio-cultural norms, particularly around the perceived need to regain respect lost during a period of visibly declining health. Capacity to call upon the support of networks of families, friends and employers was a key determinant of successful progression. Over-busy clinics, non-functioning laboratories and unsuitable tools used for ART eligibility assessment (WHO clinical staging system and centralized CD4 count measurement) were important health systems determinants of drop-out. CONCLUSIONS: Key interventions that could rapidly improve linkage include guarantee of same-day, same-clinic ART eligibility assessments; utilization of the support offered by peer-groups and community health workers; and integration of HTC and ART programmes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suboptimal tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics and HIV contribute to the high global burden of TB. We investigated costs and yield from systematic HIV-TB screening, including computer-aided digital chest X-ray (DCXR-CAD). METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this open, three-arm randomised trial, adults (≥18 years) with cough attending acute primary services in Malawi were randomised (1:1:1) to standard of care (SOC); oral HIV testing (HIV screening) and linkage to care; or HIV testing and linkage to care plus DCXR-CAD with sputum Xpert for high CAD4TBv5 scores (HIV-TB screening). Participants and study staff were not blinded to intervention allocation, but investigator blinding was maintained until final analysis. The primary outcome was time to TB treatment. Secondary outcomes included proportion with same-day TB treatment; prevalence of undiagnosed/untreated bacteriologically confirmed TB on day 56; and undiagnosed/untreated HIV. Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Cost-effectiveness analysis used a health-provider perspective. Between 15 November 2018 and 27 November 2019, 8,236 were screened for eligibility, with 473, 492, and 497 randomly allocated to SOC, HIV, and HIV-TB screening arms; 53 (11\%), 52 (9\%), and 47 (9\%) were lost to follow-up, respectively. At 56 days, TB treatment had been started in 5 (1.1\%) SOC, 8 (1.6\%) HIV screening, and 15 (3.0\%) HIV-TB screening participants. Median (IQR) time to TB treatment was 11 (6.5 to 38), 6 (1 to 22), and 1 (0 to 3) days (hazard ratio for HIV-TB versus SOC: 2.86, 1.04 to 7.87), with same-day treatment of 0/5 (0\%) SOC, 1/8 (12.5\%) HIV, and 6/15 (40.0\%) HIV-TB screening arm TB patients (p = 0.03). At day 56, 2 SOC (0.5\%), 4 HIV (1.0\%), and 2 HIV-TB (0.5\%) participants had undiagnosed microbiologically confirmed TB. HIV screening reduced the proportion with undiagnosed or untreated HIV from 10 (2.7\%) in the SOC arm to 2 (0.5\%) in the HIV screening arm (risk ratio [RR]: 0.18, 0.04 to 0.83), and 1 (0.2\%) in the HIV-TB screening arm (RR: 0.09, 0.01 to 0.71). Incremental costs were US\$3.58 and US\$19.92 per participant screened for HIV and HIV-TB; the probability of cost-effectiveness at a US\$1,200/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold was 83.9\% and 0\%. Main limitations were the lower than anticipated prevalence of TB and short participant follow-up period; cost and quality of life benefits of this screening approach may accrue over a longer time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: DCXR-CAD with universal HIV screening significantly increased the timeliness and completeness of HIV and TB diagnosis. If implemented at scale, this has potential to rapidly and efficiently improve TB and HIV diagnosis and treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT03519425.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor rates of linkage from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation are a major barrier to universal coverage of ART in sub-Saharan Africa, with reasons for failure poorly understood. In the first study of this kind at primary care level, we investigated the pathway to care in the Malawian National Programme, one of the strongest in Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective cohort study was undertaken at two primary care clinics in Blantyre, Malawi. Newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults ({$>$}15 years) were followed for 6-months to assess completion of eligibility assessments, initiation of ART and death. Two hundred and eighty participants were followed for 82.6 patient-years. ART eligibility assessments were problematic: only 134 (47.9\%) received same day WHO staging and 121 (53.2\%) completed assessments by 6-months. Completion of CD4 measurement (stage 1/2 only) was 81/153 (52.9\%). By 6-months, 87/280 (31.1\%) had initiated ART with higher uptake in participants who were ART eligible (68/91, 74.7\%), and among participants who received same-day staging (52/134 [38.8\%] vs. 35/146 [24.0\%] p = 0.007). Non-completion of ART eligibility assessments (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.11, 95\% CI: 0.06-0.21) was associated with failure to initiate ART. Retention in pre-ART care for non-ART initiators was low (55/193 [28.5\%]). Of the 15 (5.4\%) deaths, 11 (73.3\%) occurred after ART initiation. CONCLUSIONS: Although uptake of ART was high and prompt for patients with known eligibility, there was frequent failure to complete eligibility assessment and poor retention in pre-ART care. HIV care programmes should urgently evaluate the way patients are linked to ART. In particular, there is a critical need for simplified, same-day ART eligibility assessments, reduced requirements for hospital visits, and active defaulter follow-up.},

This study set out to validate a map book system for use in urban slums with no municipal address systems, where classification has been shown to be inaccurate when address descriptions were used. Between April and July 2011, 28 noncontiguous clusters were demarcated in Blantyre, Malawi. In December 2011, antiretroviral therapy initiators were asked to identify themselves as cluster residents (yes/no and which cluster) by using map books. A random sample of antiretroviral therapy initiators was used to validate map book categorization against Global Positioning System coordinates taken from participants' households. Of the 202 antiretroviral therapy initiators, 48 (23.8\%) were categorized with the map book system as in-cluster residents and 147 (72.8\%) as out-of-cluster residents, and 7 (3.4\%) were unsure. Agreement between map books and the Global Positioning System was 100\% in the 20 adults selected for validation and was 95.0\% (κ = 0.96, 95\% confidence interval: 0.84, 1.00) in an additional 20 in-cluster residents (overall κ = 0.97, 95\% confidence interval: 0.90, 1.00). With map books, cluster residents were classified rapidly and accurately. If validated elsewhere, this approach could be of widespread value in that it would enable accurate categorization without home visits.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Self-testing for HIV infection may contribute to early diagnosis of HIV, but without necessarily increasing antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether offering optional home initiation of HIV care after HIV self-testing might increase demand for ART initiation, compared with HIV self-testing accompanied by facility-based services only. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial conducted in Blantyre, Malawi, between January 30 and November 5, 2012, using restricted 1:1 randomization of 14 community health worker catchment areas. Participants were all adult (≥16 years) residents (n\,=\,16,660) who received access to home HIV self-testing through resident volunteers. This was a second-stage randomization of clusters allocated to the HIV self-testing group of a parent trial. INTERVENTIONS: Clusters were randomly allocated to facility-based care or optional home initiation of HIV care (including 2 weeks of ART if eligible) for participants reporting positive HIV self-test results. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The preplanned primary outcome compared between groups the proportion of all adult residents who initiated ART within the first 6 months of HIV self-testing availability. Secondary outcomes were uptake of HIV self-testing, reporting of positive HIV self-test results, and rates of loss from ART at 6 months. RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of adults in the home group initiated ART (181/8194, 2.2\%) compared with the facility group (63/8466, 0.7\%; risk ratio [RR], 2.94, 95\% CI, 2.10-4.12; P\,{$<$}\,.001). Uptake of HIV self-testing was high in both the home (5287/8194, 64.9\%) and facility groups (4433/8466, 52.7\%; RR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.58; P\,=\,.10). Significantly more adults reported positive HIV self-test results in the home group (490/8194 [6.0\%] vs the facility group, 278/8466 [3.3\%]; RR, 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.16-2.97; P\,=\,.006). After 6 months, 52 of 181 ART initiators (28.7\%) and 15 of 63 ART initiators (23.8\%) in the home and facility groups, respectively, were lost from ART (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.62-2.25, P\,=\,.57). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Malawian adults offered HIV self-testing, optional home initiation of care compared with standard HIV care resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of adults initiating ART.

We set out to: increase testing uptake in targeted marginalized groups through a community and genitourinary medicine (GUM)-based point of care testing (POCT) programme; and conduct a process evaluation to examine service provider inputs and document service user perceptions of the programme. METHODS: Mixed quantitative, qualitative and process evaluation methods were used. Service providers were trained to use fourth generation rapid antibody/antigen HIV tests. Existing outreach services incorporated POCT into routine practice. Clients completed a semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with service providers. RESULTS: Between September 2009 and June 2010, 953 individuals underwent POCT (GUM: 556 [59\%]; community-based sites: 397 [42\%]). Participants in the community were more likely to be male (p = 0.028), older (p {$<$} 0.001), of UK African origin (p {$<$} 0.001) and IDUs (p {$<$} 0.001) than participants from the GUM clinic. Seventeen new HIV diagnoses were confirmed (prevalence = 1.8\%), 16 of whom were in risk exposure categories (prevalence: 16/517, 3.1\%). Questionnaires and FGDs showed that clients and service providers were supportive of POCT, highlighting benefits of reaching out to marginalised communities and incorporating HIV prevention messages. CONCLUSIONS: Community and GUM clinic-based POCT for HIV was feasible and acceptable to clients and service providers in a low prevalence setting. It successfully reached target groups, many of whom would not have otherwise tested. We recommend POCT be considered among strategies to increase the uptake of HIV testing among groups who are currently underserved.},

Innovative strategies for earlier, more effective treatment are particularly important in contexts with hyper-endemic levels of HIV, where levels of TB infection remain extremely high. METHODS: We present the design of a household cluster-randomised controlled trial of interventions aimed at improving TB-free survival and reducing childhood prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among household contacts of index TB cases diagnosed in two provinces of South Africa. Households of index TB cases will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an intensified home screening and linkage for TB and HIV intervention, or enhanced standard of care. The primary outcome will compare between groups the TB-free survival of household contacts over 15\,months. All participants, or their next-of-kin, will provide written informed consent to participate.

The aims were to determine the relative contribution of death to cohort exit and the causes and predictors of mortality among HAART initiators. A community outreach programme traced non-attenders. Patients categorised as dying at home underwent a verbal autopsy (by interviewing family members) and case-file review, and those dying in hospital a case-file review, to determine the probable cause of death. At 24 months 1131 (83.6\%) patients were retained on treatment in the programme, 124 (9.2\%) had died, 63 (4.7\%) had transferred out, and 35 (2.6\%) were lost to follow-up. The most common causes of death were tuberculosis (44.3\%) and diarrhoeal diseases (24.5\%). Death was the major reason for cohort exit. As experience is gained with rural HAART programmes mortality rates may decrease. These results draw attention to the need for early HIV diagnosis, increased access to HAART services with earlier treatment initiation, and routine screening and aggressive management of opportunistic infections, particularly tuberculosis.},

We report the investigation and management of a point-source outbreak that occurred during a Black Friday promotional event in North West England. Methods: Outbreak investigation was led by Public Health England, and included active case finding among individuals pierced at a piercing premises between 25/11/2016 (Black Friday) and 7/12/2016. Detailed epidemiological, environmental (including inspection and sampling), and microbiological investigation was undertaken. Results: During the Black Friday event (25/11/2016), 45 people were pierced (13 by a newly-appointed practitioner). Eleven cases were identified (7 microbiologically-confirmed, 2 probable, and 2 possible). All cases had clinical signs of infection around piercing sites, and five required surgical intervention, with varying degrees of post-operative disfigurement. All confirmed and probable cases had a scaffold piercing placed with a guide bar by the newly-appointed practitioner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indistinguishable at nine-locus variable-number tandem repeat loci, was isolated from four of the confirmed cases, and from pre- and post-flush samples from five separate water taps (three sinks) in the premises. Water samples taken after remedial plumbing work confirmed elimination of Pseudomonas contamination. Discussion: Although high levels of Pseudomonas water contamination and some poor infection control procedures were identified, infection appeared to require additional exposure to an inexperienced practitioner, and the more invasive scaffold piercing. A proactive collaborative approach between piercers and health and environmental officials is required to reduce outbreak risk, particularly when unusually large events are planned.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of loss to follow-up in smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients before treatment initiation and outcomes among patients who were traced. METHODS: Ovid Medline and Global Health databases were searched for studies published between 1994 and January 2013 that described pre-treatment loss to follow-up in patients with smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis in routine national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) in low- and lower-middle-income countries and in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. Data on the proportion of patients who did not initiate treatment after their tuberculosis diagnosis were extracted from studies meeting inclusion criteria. Where available, data on causes and outcomes, including initiation of tuberculosis treatment at another facility, were investigated. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed and random-effects meta-analyses by subgroup (region) were performed. FINDINGS: Twenty-three eligible studies were identified, with a total of 34\,706 smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients from 14 countries (8 in Africa, 5 in Asia and 1 in the western Pacific). Most studies were retrospective and linked laboratory and treatment registers to identify pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Pre-treatment loss to follow-up varied from 4 to 38\% and was common in studies from Africa (random-effects weighted proportion, WP: 18\%; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 13-22) and Asia (WP: 13\%; 95\% CI: 10-15). CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment loss to follow-up, common in most settings, can hinder tuberculosis control efforts. By not counting individuals who are lost to follow-up before treatment when reporting standard programme indicators, NTPs underestimate case detection rates and mortality and overestimate cure rates.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Household contacts of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) often have latent TB infection, and are at risk of progression to disease. We set out to investigate whether index TB case HIV status was linked to a higher probability of latent TB infection among household contacts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from participants in the intervention arm of a household cluster-randomised trial in two South Africa provinces (Mangaung, Free State, and Capricorn, Limpopo). In intervention group households, TB contacts underwent HIV testing and tuberculin skin testing (TST). TST induration was estimated at two cut-offs (≥5mm, ≥10mm). Multilevel Bayesian regression models estimated posterior distributions of the percentage of household contacts with TST induration ≥5mm and ≥10mm by age group, and compared the odds of latent TB infection by key risk factors including HIV status index case age and study province. RESULTS: A total of 2,985 household contacts of 924 index cases were assessed, with most 2,725 (91.3\%) undergoing TST. HIV prevalence in household contacts was 14\% and 10\% in Mangaung and Capricorn respectively. Overall, 16.8\% (458/2,725) had TST induration of ≥5mm and 13.1\% (359/2,725) ≥10mm. In Mangaung, children aged 0-4 years had a high TST positivity prevalence compared to their peers in Capricorn (22.0\% vs. 7.6\%, and 20.5\% vs. 2.3\%, using TST thresholds of ≥5mm and ≥10mm respectively). Compared to contacts from Capricorn, household contacts living in Mangaung were more likely to have TST induration ≥5mm (odds ratio [OR]: 3.08, 95\% credibility interval [CI]: 2.13-4.58) and ≥10mm (OR: 4.52, 95\% CI: 3.03-6.97). There was a 90\% and 92\% posterior probability that the odds of TST induration ≥5mm (OR: 0.79, 95\% CI: 0.56-1.14) and ≥10mm (OR: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.53-1.10) respectively were lower in household contacts of HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative index cases. CONCLUSIONS: High TST induration positivity, especially among young children and people living in Mangaung indicates considerable TB transmission despite high antiretroviral therapy coverage. Household contact of HIV-positive index TB cases were less likely to have evidence of latent TB infection than contacts of HIV-negative index cases.},

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of service delivery interventions to improve adolescents' linkage from HIV diagnosis to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, retention in HIV care and adherence to ART. METHODS: We systematically searched the Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Sciences databases and conference abstracts from the International AIDS Conference and International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA). Studies published in English between 1st January 2001 and 9th June 2014 were included. Two authors independently evaluated reports for eligibility, extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: Eleven studies from nine countries were eligible for review. Three studies were randomised controlled trials. Interventions assessed included individual and group counselling and education; peer support; directly observed therapy; financial incentives; and interventions to improve the adolescent-friendliness of clinics. Most studies were of low to moderate methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified limited evidence on the effectiveness of service delivery interventions to support adolescents' linkage from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation, retention on ART and adherence to ART. Although recommendations are qualified because of the small numbers of studies and limited methodological quality, offering individual and group education and counselling, financial incentives, increasing clinic accessibility and provision of specific adolescent-tailored services appear promising interventions and warrant further investigation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS related stigma is a major barrier to uptake of HIV testing and counselling (HTC). We assessed the extent of stigmatising attitudes expressed by participants offered community-based HTC, and their anticipated stigma from others to assess relationship with HIV test uptake. From these data, we constructed a brief stigma scale for use around the time of HIV testing. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult members of 60 households in urban Blantyre, Malawi, were selected using population-weighted random cluster sampling and offered HTC with the option to self-test before confirmatory HTC. Prior to HTC a 15-item HIV stigma questionnaire was administered. We used association testing and principal components analysis (PCA) to construct a scale measure of stigma. Of 226 adults invited to participate, 216 (95.6\%) completed questionnaires and 198/216 (91.7\%) opted to undergo HTC (all self-tested). Stigmatising attitudes were uncommon, but anticipated stigma was common, especially fearing verbal abuse (22\%) or being abandoned by their partner (11\%). Three questions showed little association or consistency with the remaining 12 stigma questions and were not included in the final scale. For the 12-question final scale, Cronbach's alpha was 0.75. Level of stigma was not associated with previously having tested for HIV (p = 0.318) or agreeing to HTC (p = 0.379), but was associated with expressed worry about being or becoming HIV infected (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Anticipated stigma prior to HTC was common among both men and women. However, the high uptake of HTC suggests that this did not translate into reluctance to accept community-based testing. We constructed a brief scale to measure stigma at the time of HIV testing that could rapidly identify individuals requiring additional support following diagnosis and monitor the impact of increasing availability of community-based HTC on prevalence of stigma.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand reasons for suboptimal and delayed uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by describing the patterns of HIV testing and counselling (HTC) and outcomes of ART eligibility assessments in primary clinic attendees. METHODS: All clinic attendances and episodes of HTC were recorded at two clinics in Blantyre. A cohort of newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults ({$>$}15 years) was recruited and exit interviews undertaken. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate factors associated with referral to start ART. Qualitative interviews were conducted with providers and patients. RESULTS: There were 2398 episodes of HTC during 18,021 clinic attendances (13.3\%) between January and April 2011. The proportion of clinic attendees undergoing HTC was lowest in non-pregnant women (6.3\%) and men (8.5\%), compared with pregnant women (47.2\%). Men had more advanced HIV infection than women (79.7\% WHO stage 3 or 4 vs. 56.4\%). Problems with WHO staging and access to CD4 counts affected ART eligibility assessments; only 48\% completed ART eligibility assessment, and 54\% of those reporting WHO stage 3/4 illnesses were not referred to start ART promptly. On multivariate analysis, HIV-positive pregnant women were significantly less likely to be referred directly for ART initiation (adjusted OR: 0.29, 95\% CI: 0.13-0.63). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) has not yet been fully implemented at primary care clinics. Suboptimal ART eligibility assessments and referral (reflecting the difficulties of WHO staging in primary care) mean that simplified eligibility assessment tools are required to reduce unnecessary delay and attrition in the pre-ART period. Simplified initiation criteria for pregnant women, as being introduced in Malawi, should improve linkage to ART.},

  abstract = {Background: Human immunodeficiency virus self-testing (HIVST) is effective, with scale-up underway in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed cost-effectiveness of adding HIVST to existing facility-based HIV testing and counseling (HTC) services. Both 2010 (initiate at CD4 {$<$}350 cells/μL) and 2015 (initiate all) World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for antiretroviral treatment (ART) were considered. Methods: A microsimulation model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness, from both health provider and societal perspectives, of an HIVST service implemented in a cluster-randomized trial (CRT; ISRCTN02004005) in Malawi. Costs and health outcomes were evaluated over a 20-year time horizon, using a discount rate of 3\%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for parameter uncertainty. Results: From the health provider perspective and 20-year time horizon, facility HTC using 2010 WHO ART guidelines was the least costly (\$294.71 per person; 95\% credible interval [CrI], 270.79-318.45) and least effective (11.64 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] per person; 95\% CrI, 11.43-11.86) strategy. Compared with this strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for facility HTC using 2015 WHO ART guidelines was \$226.85 (95\% CrI, 198.79-284.35) per QALY gained. The strategy of facility HTC plus HIVST, using 2010 WHO ART guidelines, was extendedly dominated. The ICER for facility HTC plus HIVST, using 2015 WHO ART guidelines, was \$253.90 (95\% CrI, 201.71-342.02) per QALY gained compared with facility HTC and using 2015 WHO ART guidelines. Conclusions: HIVST may be cost-effective in a Malawian population with high HIV prevalence. HIVST is suited to an early HIV diagnosis and treatment strategy.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV self-testing (HIVST) has been found to be highly effective, but no cost analysis has been undertaken to guide the design of affordable and scalable implementation strategies. METHODS: Consecutive HIV self-testers and facility-based testers were recruited from participants in a community cluster-randomised trial ( ISRCTN02004005 ) investigating the impact of offering HIVST in addition to facility-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC). Primary costing studies were undertaken of the HIVST service and of health facilities providing HTC to the trial population. Costs were adjusted to 2014 US\$ and INT\$. Recruited participants were asked about direct non-medical and indirect costs associated with accessing either modality of HIV testing, and additionally their health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D. RESULTS: A total of 1,241 participants underwent either HIVST (n\,=\,775) or facility-based HTC (n\,=\,446). The mean societal cost per participant tested through HIVST (US\$9.23; 95 \% CI: US\$9.14-US\$9.32) was lower than through facility-based HTC (US\$11.84; 95 \% CI: US\$10.81-12.86). Although the mean health provider cost per participant tested through HIVST (US\$8.78) was comparable to facility-based HTC (range: US\$7.53-US\$10.57), the associated mean direct non-medical and indirect cost was lower (US\$2.93; 95 \% CI: US\$1.90-US\$3.96). The mean health provider cost per HIV positive participant identified through HIVST was higher (US\$97.50) than for health facilities (range: US\$25.18-US\$76.14), as was the mean cost per HIV positive individual assessed for anti-retroviral treatment (ART) eligibility and the mean cost per HIV positive individual initiated onto ART. In comparison to the facility-testing group, the adjusted mean EQ-5D utility score was 0.046 (95 \% CI: 0.022-0.070) higher in the HIVST group. CONCLUSIONS: HIVST reduces the economic burden on clients, but is a costlier strategy for the health provider aiming to identify HIV positive individuals for treatment. The provider cost of HIVST could be substantially lower under less restrictive distribution models, or if costs of oral fluid HIV test kits become comparable to finger-prick kits used in health facilities.},

SETTING: HIV clinics in Blantyre, Malawi. METHODS: Consecutive HIV-positive participants, diagnosed by HIVST or facility-based HTC as part of a community cluster-randomized trial (ISRCTN02004005), were followed from initial assessment for ART until 1-year postinitiation. Healthcare resource use was prospectively measured, and primary costing studies undertaken to estimate total health provider costs. Participants were interviewed to establish direct nonmedical and indirect costs over the first year of ART. Costs were adjusted to 2014 US\$ and INT\$. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D at each clinic visit. Multivariable analyses estimated predictors of economic outcomes. RESULTS: Of 325 participants attending HIV clinics for assessment for ART, 265 were identified through facility-based HTC, and 60 through HIVST; 168/265 (69.2\%) and 36/60 (60.0\%), respectively, met national ART eligibility criteria and initiated treatment. The mean total health provider assessment costs for ART initiation were US\$22.79 (SE: 0.56) and US\$19.92 (SE: 0.77) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively, and was US\$2.87 (bootstrap 95\% CI: US\$1.01 to US\$4.73) lower for the HIVST group. The mean total health provider costs for the first year of ART were US\$168.65 (SE: 2.02) and US\$164.66 (SE: 4.21) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively, and comparable between the 2 groups (bootstrap 95\% CI: -US\$12.38 to US\$4.39). EQ-5D utility scores immediately before and one year after ART initiation were comparable between the 2 groups. EQ-5D utility scores 1 year after ART initiation had increased by 0.129 (SE: 0.011) and 0.139 (SE: 0.027) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Once HIV self-testers are linked into HIV services, their economic outcomes are comparable to those linking to services after facility-based HTC.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patients with tuberculosis (TB) symptoms have high prevalence of HIV, and should be prioritised for HIV testing. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study in Bangwe primary care clinic, Blantyre, Malawi, all adults (18 years or older) presenting with an acute illness were screened for TB symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss). Demographic characteristics were linked to exit interview by fingerprint bioidentification. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the proportion completing same-visit HIV testing, comparing between those with and without TB symptoms. RESULTS: There were 5427 adult attendees between 21/5/2018 and 6/9/2018. Exit interviews were performed for 2402 (44\%). 276 patients were excluded from the analysis, being already on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Presentation with any TB symptom was common for men (54.6\%) and women (57.4\%). Overall 27.6\% (585/ 2121) attenders reported being offered testing and 21.5\% (455/2121) completed provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) and received results. The proportions offered testing were similar among participants with and without TB symptoms (any TB symptom: 29.0\% vs. 25.7\%). This was consistent for each individual symptom; cough, weight loss, fever and night sweats. Multivariable regression models indicated men, younger adults and participants who had previously tested were more likely to complete PITC than women, older adults and those who had never previously tested. CONCLUSIONS: Same-visit completion of HIV testing was suboptimal, especially among groups known to have high prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. As countries approach universal coverage of ART, identifying and prioritising currently underserved groups for HIV testing will be essential.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global roll-out of rapid molecular assays is revolutionising the diagnosis of rifampicin resistance, predictive of multidrug-resistance, in tuberculosis. However, 30\% of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in an eSwatini study harboured the Ile491Phe mutation in the rpoB gene, which is associated with poor rifampicin-based treatment outcomes but is missed by commercial molecular assays or scored as susceptible by phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing deployed in South Africa. We evaluated the presence of Ile491Phe among South African tuberculosis isolates reported as isoniazid-monoresistant according to current national testing algorithms. METHODS: We screened records of 37\hphantom{,}644 Mycobacterium tuberculosis positive cultures from four South African provinces, diagnosed at the National Health Laboratory Service-Dr George Mukhari Tertiary Laboratory, to identify isolates with rifampicin sensitivity and isoniazid resistance according to Xpert MTB/RIF, GenoType MTBDRplus, and BACTEC MGIT 960. Of 1823 isolates that met these criteria, 277 were randomly selected and screened for Ile491Phe with multiplex allele-specific PCR and Sanger sequencing of rpoB. Ile491Phe-positive strains (as well as 17 Ile491Phe-bearing isolates from the eSwatini study) were then tested by Deeplex-MycTB deep sequencing and whole-genome sequencing to evaluate their patterns of extensive resistance, transmission, and evolution. FINDINGS: Ile491Phe was identified in 37 (15\%) of 249 samples with valid multiplex allele-specific PCR and sequencing results, thus reclassifying them as MDR. All 37 isolates were additionally identified as genotypically resistant to all first-line drugs by Deeplex-MycTB. Six of the South African isolates harboured four distinct mutations potentially associated with decreased bedaquiline sensitivity. Consistent with Deeplex-MycTB genotypic profiles, whole-genome sequencing revealed concurrent silent spread in South Africa of a MDR tuberculosis strain lineage extending from the eSwatini outbreak and at least another independently emerged Ile491Phe-bearing lineage. Whole-genome sequencing further suggested acquisition of mechanisms compensating for the Ile491Phe fitness cost, and of additional bedaquiline resistance following the introduction of this drug in South Africa. INTERPRETATION: A substantial number of MDR tuberculosis cases harbouring the Ile491Phe mutation in the rpoB gene in South Africa are missed by current diagnostic strategies, resulting in ineffective first-line treatment, continued amplification of drug resistance, and concurrent silent spread in the community.

However, these targets will not be achieved at the current rate of progress. METHODS: We performed a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam, to evaluate the effectiveness of active community-wide screening, as compared with standard passive case detection alone, for reducing the prevalence of tuberculosis. Persons 15 years of age or older who resided in 60 intervention clusters (subcommunes) were screened for pulmonary tuberculosis, regardless of symptoms, annually for 3 years, beginning in 2014, by means of rapid nucleic acid amplification testing of spontaneously expectorated sputum samples. Active screening was not performed in the 60 control clusters in the first 3 years. The primary outcome, measured in the fourth year, was the prevalence of microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis among persons 15 years of age or older. The secondary outcome was the prevalence of tuberculosis infection, as assessed by an interferon gamma release assay in the fourth year, among children born in 2012. RESULTS: In the fourth-year prevalence survey, we tested 42,150 participants in the intervention group and 41,680 participants in the control group. A total of 53 participants in the intervention group (126 per 100,000 population) and 94 participants in the control group (226 per 100,000) had pulmonary tuberculosis, as confirmed by a positive nucleic acid amplification test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (prevalence ratio, 0.56; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.40 to 0.78; P{$<$}0.001). The prevalence of tuberculosis infection in children born in 2012 was 3.3\% in the intervention group and 2.6\% in the control group (prevalence ratio, 1.29; 95\% CI, 0.70 to 2.36; P\,=\,0.42). CONCLUSIONS: Three years of community-wide screening in persons 15 years of age or older who resided in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam, resulted in a lower prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis in the fourth year than standard passive case detection alone.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2014, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and partners set the 90-90-90 target for the year 2020: diagnose 90\% of all people living with HIV (PLHIV); treat 90\% of people who know their status; and suppress the virus in 90\% of people on treatment. In 2015, countries began reporting to UNAIDS on progress against 90-90-90 using standard definitions and methods. METHODS: We used data submitted to UNAIDS from 170 countries to assess country-specific progress towards 90-90-90 through 2018. To assess global and regional progress, overall and by sex for adults aged 15 years and older, we combined country-reported data with estimates generated with a Bayesian hierarchical model. RESULTS: A total of 60 countries reported on all three 90s in 2018, up from 23 in 2015. Among all PLHIV worldwide, 79\% (67-92\%) knew their HIV status. Of these, 78\% (69-82\%) were accessing treatment and 86\% (72-92\%) of people accessing treatment had suppressed viral loads. Of the 37.9 million (32.7-44.0 million) PLHIV worldwide, 53\% (43-63\%) had suppressed viral loads. The gap to fully achieving 73\% of PLHIV with suppressed viral load was 7.7 million; 15 countries had already achieved this target by 2018. CONCLUSION: Increased data availability has led to improved measures of country and global progress towards the 90-90-90 target. Although gains in access to testing and treatment continue, many countries and regions are unlikely to reach the 90-90-90 target by 2020.},

  abstract = {Tuberculosis is a major cause of death and disability among children globally, yet children have been neglected in global tuberculosis control efforts. Historically, tuberculosis in children has been thought of as a family disease, and because of this, household contact tracing of children after identification of an adult tuberculosis case has been emphasised as the principal public health intervention. However, the population-level effect of household contact tracing is predicated on the assumption that most paediatric tuberculosis infections are acquired within the household. In this Personal View, we focus on accumulating scientific evidence indicating that the majority of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission to children in high-burden settings occurs in the community, outside of households in which a person has tuberculosis. We estimate the population-attributable fraction of M tuberculosis transmission to children due to household exposures to be between 10\% and 30\%. M tuberculosis transmission from the household was low ({$<$}30\%) even in children younger than age 5 years. We propose that an effective public health response to childhood tuberculosis requires comprehensive, community-based interventions, such as active surveillance in select settings, rather than contact tracing alone. Importantly, the historical paradigm that most paediatric transmission occurs in households should be reconsidered on the basis of the scientific knowledge presented.},

  abstract = {The individual- and population-level impact of household tuberculosis exposure on transmission is unclear but may have implications for the effectiveness and implementation of control interventions. We systematically searched for and included studies in which latent tuberculosis infection was assessed in 2 groups: children exposed and unexposed to a household member with tuberculosis. We also extracted data on the smear and culture status of index cases, the age and bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination status of contacts, and study design characteristics. Of 6,176 citations identified from our search strategy, 26 studies (13,999 children with household exposure to tuberculosis and 174,097 children without) from 1929-2015 met inclusion criteria. Exposed children were 3.79 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 3.01, 4.78) times more likely to be infected than were their community counterparts. Metaregression demonstrated higher infection among children aged 0-4 years of age compared with children aged 10-14 years (ratio of odds ratios~=~2.24, 95\% CI: 1.43, 3.51) and among smear-positive versus smear-negative index cases (ratio of odds ratios~=~5.45, 95\% CI: 3.43, 8.64). At the population level, we estimated that a small proportion ({$<$}20\%) of transmission was attributable to household exposure. Our results suggest that targeting tuberculosis prevention efforts to household contacts is highly effective. However, a large proportion of transmission at the population level may occur outside the household.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Household contact tracing for tuberculosis (TB) may facilitate TB diagnosis and identify individuals who may benefit from TB preventive therapy (TPT). In this cluster-randomised trial, we investigated whether household contact tracing and intensive TB/HIV screening would improve TB-free survival. METHODS: Household contacts of index TB patients in two Provinces of South Africa were randomised to home tracing and intensive HIV/TB screening (sputum Xpert and culture; HIV testing with treatment linkage; and TPT, if eligible), or standard of care (SOC, clinic referral letters). The primary outcome was incident TB or death at 15-months. Secondary outcomes included tuberculin skin test (TST) positivity in children ≤14 years and undiagnosed HIV. (ISRCTN16006202). RESULTS: From December 2016-March 2019, 1,032 index patients (4,459 contacts) and 1,030 (4,129 contacts) were randomised to the intervention and SOC arms. 3.2\% (69/2166) of intervention arm contacts had prevalent microbiologically-confirmed TB. At 15-months, the cumulative incidence of TB or death did not differ between the intensive screening (93/3230, 2.9\%) and SOC (80/2600, 3.1\%) arms (hazard ratio: 0.90, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.24). TST positivity was higher in the intensive screening arm (38/845, 4.5\%) compared to the SOC arm (15/800, 1.9\%, odds ratio: 2.25, 95\% CI: 1.07-4.72). Undiagnosed HIV was similar between arms (41/3185, 1.3\% vs. 32/2543, 1.3\%; odds ratio: 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.64-1.64). CONCLUSIONS: Household contact tracing with intensive screening and referral did not reduce incident TB or death. Providing referral letters to household contacts of index patients is an alternative strategy to home visits in high TB/HIV-prevalence settings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In high-incidence settings, recurrent disease among previously treated individuals contributes substantially to the burden of incident and prevalent tuberculosis. The extent to which interventions targeted to this high-risk group can improve tuberculosis control has not been established. We aimed to project the population-level effect of control interventions targeted to individuals with a history of previous tuberculosis treatment in a high-incidence setting. METHODS: We developed a transmission-dynamic model of tuberculosis and HIV in a high-incidence setting with a population of roughly 40\hphantom{,}000 people in suburban Cape Town, South Africa. The model was calibrated to data describing local demography, TB and HIV prevalence, TB case notifications and treatment outcomes using a Bayesian calibration approach. We projected the effect of annual targeted active case finding in all individuals who had previously completed tuberculosis treatment and targeted active case finding combined with lifelong secondary isoniazid preventive therapy. We estimated the effect of these targeted interventions on local tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality over a 10 year period (2016-25). FINDINGS: We projected that, under current control efforts in this setting, the tuberculosis epidemic will remain in slow decline for at least the next decade. Additional interventions targeted to previously treated people could greatly accelerate these declines. We projected that annual targeted active case finding combined with secondary isoniazid preventive therapy in those who previously completed tuberculosis treatment would avert 40\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 21-56) of incident tuberculosis cases and 41\% (16-55) of tuberculosis deaths occurring between 2016 and 2025. INTERPRETATION: In this high-incidence setting, the use of targeted active case finding in combination with secondary isoniazid preventive therapy in previously treated individuals could accelerate decreases in tuberculosis morbidity and mortality. Studies to measure cost and resource implications are needed to establish the feasibility of this type of targeted approach for improving tuberculosis control in settings with high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite antiretroviral therapy (ART) being widely available, HIV continues to cause substantial illness and premature death in low-and-middle-income countries. High rates of loss to follow-up after HIV diagnosis can delay people starting ART. Starting ART within seven days of HIV diagnosis (rapid ART initiation) could reduce loss to follow-up, improve virological suppression rates, and reduce mortality. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for rapid initiation of ART (defined as offering ART within seven days of HIV diagnosis) on treatment outcomes and mortality in people living with HIV. We also aimed to describe the characteristics of rapid ART interventions used in the included studies. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, and four other databases up to 14 August 2018. There was no restriction on date, language, or publication status. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and websites for unpublished literature, including conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared rapid ART versus standard care in people living with HIV. Children, adults, and adolescents from any setting were eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies identified in the search, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcomes were mortality and virological suppression at 12 months. We have presented all outcomes using risk ratios (RR), with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Where appropriate, we pooled the results in meta-analysis. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included seven studies with 18,011 participants in the review. All studies were carried out in low- and middle-income countries in adults aged 18 years old or older. Only one study included pregnant women.In all the studies, the rapid ART intervention was offered as part of a package that included several cointerventions targeting individuals, health workers and health system processes delivered alongside rapid ART that aimed to facilitate uptake and adherence to ART.Comparing rapid ART with standard initiation probably results in greater viral suppression at 12 months (RR 1.18, 95\% CI 1.10 to 1.27; 2719 participants, 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence) and better ART uptake at 12 months (RR 1.09, 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.12; 3713 participants, 4 studies; moderate-certainty evidence), and may improve retention in care at 12 months (RR 1.22, 95\% CI 1.11 to 1.35; 5001 participants, 6 studies; low-certainty evidence). Rapid ART initiation was associated with a lower mortality estimate, however the CIs included no effect when compared to standard of care (RR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.51 to 1.01; 5451 participants, 7 studies; very low-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether rapid ART has an effect on modification of ART treatment regimens as data are lacking (RR 7.89, 95\% CI 0.76 to 81.74; 977 participants, 2 studies; very low-certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to draw conclusions on the occurrence of adverse events. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: RCTs that include initiation of ART within one week of diagnosis appear to improve outcomes across the HIV treatment cascade in low- and middle-income settings. The studies demonstrating these effects delivered rapid ART combined with several setting-specific cointerventions. This highlights the need for pragmatic research to identify feasible packages that assure the effects seen in the trials when delivered through complex health systems.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-tuberculosis lung damage (PTLD) is a recognised consequence of pulmonary TB (pTB). However, little is known about its prevalence, patterns and associated outcomes, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and HIV-positive adults. METHODS: Adult (≥15 years) survivors of a first episode of pTB in Blantyre, Malawi, completed the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, spirometry and high-resolution CT (HRCT) chest imaging at TB treatment completion. Symptom, spirometry, health seeking, TB-retreatment and mortality data were collected prospectively to 1\,year. Risk factors for persistent symptoms, pulmonary function decline and respiratory-related health-seeking were identified through multivariable regression modelling. RESULTS: Between February 2016 and April 2017, 405 participants were recruited. Median age was 35 years (IQR: 28 to 41), 77.3\% (313/405) had had microbiologically proven pTB, and 60.3\% (244/403) were HIV-positive. At pTB treatment completion, 60.7\% (246/405) reported respiratory symptoms, 34.2\% (125/365) had abnormal spirometry, 44.2\% (170/385) had bronchiectasis ≥1\,lobe and 9.4\% (36/385) had ≥1 destroyed lobe on HRCT imaging. At 1\,year, 30.7\% (113/368) reported respiratory symptoms, 19.3\% (59/305) and 14.1\% (43/305) of patients had experienced declines in FEV1 or FVC of ≥100\,mL, 16.3\% (62/380) had reported ≥1 acute respiratory event and 12.2\% (45/368) had symptoms affecting their ability to work. CONCLUSIONS: PTLD is a common and under-recognised consequence of pTB that is disabling for patients and associated with adverse outcomes beyond pTB treatment completion. Increased efforts to prevent PTLD and guidelines for management of established disease are urgently needed. Low-cost clinical interventions to improve patient outcomes must be evaluated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is an important risk factor for chronic respiratory disease in resource poor settings. The persistence of abnormal spirometry and symptoms after treatment are well described, but the structural abnormalities underlying these changes remain poorly defined, limiting our ability to phenotype post-TB lung disease in to meaningful categories for clinical management, prognostication, and ongoing research. The relationship between post-TB lung damage and patient-centred outcomes including functional impairment, respiratory symptoms, and health related quality of life also remains unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review to determine the prevalence and pattern of imaging-defined lung pathology in adults after medical treatment for pleural, miliary, or pulmonary TB disease. Data were collected on study characteristics, and the modality, timing, and findings of thoracic imaging. The proportion of studies relating imaging findings to spirometry results and patient morbidity was recorded. Study quality was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottowa score. (Prospero Registration number CRD42015027958). RESULTS: We identified 37 eligible studies. The principle features seen on CXR were cavitation (8.3-83.7\%), bronchiectasis (4.3-11.2\%), and fibrosis (25.0-70.4\%), but prevalence was highly variable. CT imaging identified a wider range of residual abnormalities than CXR, including nodules (25.0-55.8\%), consolidation (3.7-19.2\%), and emphysema (15.0-45.0\%). The prevalence of cavitation was generally lower (7.4-34.6\%) and bronchiectasis higher (35.0-86.0\%) on CT vs. CXR imaging. A paucity of prospective data, and data from HIV-infected adults and sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) was noted. Few studies related structural damage to physiological impairment, respiratory symptoms, or patient morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Post-TB structural lung pathology is common. Prospective data are required to determine the evolution of this lung damage and its associated morbidity over time. Further data are required from HIV-infected groups and those living in sSA.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A rapid, blood-based triage test that allows targeted investigation for tuberculosis at the point of care could shorten the time to tuberculosis treatment and reduce mortality. We aimed to test the performance of a host blood transcriptomic signature (RISK11) in diagnosing tuberculosis and predicting progression to active pulmonary disease (prognosis) in people with HIV in a community setting. METHODS: In this prospective diagnostic and prognostic accuracy study, adults (aged 18-59 years) with HIV were recruited from five communities in South Africa. Individuals with a history of tuberculosis or household exposure to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis within the past 3 years, comorbid risk factors for tuberculosis, or any condition that would interfere with the study were excluded. RISK11 status was assessed at baseline by real-time PCR; participants and study staff were masked to the result. Participants underwent active surveillance for microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis by providing spontaneously expectorated sputum samples at baseline, if symptomatic during 15 months of follow-up, and at 15 months (the end of the study). The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence and cumulative incidence of tuberculosis disease confirmed by a positive Xpert MTB/RIF, Xpert Ultra, or Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube culture, or a combination of such, on at least two separate sputum samples collected within any 30-day period. FINDINGS: Between March 22, 2017, and May 15, 2018, 963 participants were assessed for eligibility and 861 were enrolled. Among 820 participants with valid RISK11 results, eight (1\%) had prevalent tuberculosis at baseline: seven (2·5\%; 95\% CI 1·2-5·0) of 285 RISK11-positive participants and one (0·2\%; 0·0-1·1) of 535 RISK11-negative participants. The relative risk (RR) of prevalent tuberculosis was 13·1 times (95\% CI 2·1-81·6) greater in RISK11-positive participants than in RISK11-negative participants. RISK11 had a diagnostic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 88·2\% (95\% CI 77·6-96·7), and a sensitivity of 87·5\% (58·3-100·0) and specificity of 65·8\% (62·5-69·0) at a predefined score threshold (60\%). Of those with RISK11 results, eight had primary endpoint incident tuberculosis during 15 months of follow-up. Tuberculosis incidence was 2·5 per 100 person-years (95\% CI 0·7-4·4) in the RISK11-positive group and 0·2 per 100 person-years (0·0-0·5) in the RISK11-negative group. The probability of primary endpoint incident tuberculosis was greater in the RISK11-positive group than in the RISK11-negative group (cumulative incidence ratio 16·0 [95\% CI 2·0-129·5]). RISK11 had a prognostic AUC of 80·0\% (95\% CI 70·6-86·9), and a sensitivity of 88·6\% (43·5-98·7) and a specificity of 68·9\% (65·3-72·3) for incident tuberculosis at the 60\% threshold. INTERPRETATION: RISK11 identified prevalent tuberculosis and predicted risk of progression to incident tuberculosis within 15 months in ambulant people living with HIV. RISK11's performance approached, but did not meet, WHO's target product profile benchmarks for screening and prognostic tests for tuberculosis.

  abstract = {Human mobility is a core component of human behavior and its quantification is critical for understanding its impact on infectious disease transmission, traffic forecasting, access to resources and care, intervention strategies, and migratory flows. When mobility data are limited, spatial interaction models have been widely used to estimate human travel, but have not been extensively validated in low- and middle-income settings. Geographic, sociodemographic, and infrastructure differences may impact the ability for models to capture these patterns, particularly in rural settings. Here, we analyzed mobility patterns inferred from mobile phone data in four Sub-Saharan African countries to investigate the ability for variants on gravity and radiation models to estimate travel. Adjusting the gravity model such that parameters were fit to different trip types, including travel between more or less populated areas and/or different regions, improved model fit in all four countries. This suggests that alternative models may be more useful in these settings and better able to capture the range of mobility patterns observed.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: In 2005, we reported high prevalence of untreated pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a South African community. Prevalent untreated TB is the main source of transmission. In settings with large burdens of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may contribute to TB control. OBJECTIVES: To assess the community-level impact of HAART on TB prevalence, we repeated a community-based TB prevalence cross-sectional survey in 2008 following HAART roll-out. METHODS: A random 10\% adult population sample was identified from the community. Participants provided two sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli microscopy and TB culture. Oral transudate specimen was collected for anonymous HIV testing, linked to TB diagnosis. An interviewer-administered, structured questionnaire identified TB and HIV history and risk factors. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the 2008 survey, 1,250 adults participated (90\% response rate); 306 (25\%) tested HIV positive, of which 60 (20\%) were receiving HAART. A total of 20 TB cases were identified (12 receiving TB treatment), representing a significant decline in prevalence from 3.2 to 1.6\% (P = 0.02) between the surveys. TB prevalence in participants not infected with HIV was unchanged (P = 0.90). The decline occurred among participants not infected with HIV, decreasing from 9.2 to 3.6\% in 2005 to 2008, respectively (P = 0.003). In participants infected with HIV, prevalence of treated TB declined from 4 to 2.3\% (P = 0.06), and untreated TB prevalence from 5.2 to 1.3\% (P = 0.02). The proportion of untreated TB in patients receiving HAART decreased significantly, from 22 to 0\% (P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of undiagnosed TB declined significantly over a period of increasing HAART availability. The decline was predominantly in individuals infected with HIV receiving HAART.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) in high TB and HIV prevalent settings is required in order to develop effective intervention strategies for TB control. However, there are little data assessing incidence of TB infection in adolescents in these settings. METHODS: We performed a tuberculin skin test (TST) and HIV survey among secondary school learners in a high HIV and TB prevalence community. TST responses to purified protein derivative RT23 were read after 3 days. HIV-infection was assessed using Orasure(R) collection device and ELISA testing. The results of the HIV-uninfected participants were combined with those from previous surveys among primary school learners in the same community, and force of TB infection was calculated by age. RESULTS: The age of 820 secondary school participants ranged from 13 to 22 years. 159 participants had participated in the primary school surveys. At a 10 mm cut-off, prevalence of TB infection among HIV-uninfected and first time participants, was 54\% (n = 334/620). HIV prevalence was 5\% (n = 40/816). HIV infection was not significantly associated with TST positivity (p = 0.07). In the combined survey dataset, TB prevalence was 45\% (n = 645/1451), and was associated with increasing age and male gender. Force of infection increased with age, from 3\% to 7.3\% in adolescents {$>$}/= 20 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: We show a high force of infection among adolescents, positively associated with increasing age. We postulate this is due to increased social contact with infectious TB cases. Control of the TB epidemic in this setting will require reducing the force of infection.},

  abstract = {Immune senescence is a significant contributor to health problems in the developed world and may be accelerated by chronic viral infections. To date, there have been few studies of immune function in healthy older people in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed T cell and B cell phenotypes and immune responses to CMV, EBV, and influenza virus in Malawians aged 20-69 y. Notably, the proportion of naive (CCR7+CD45RA+) CD4 and CD8 T cells was only 14\% of the lymphoid repertoire even in donors aged under 30 y but did not decrease further with age. A small increase in the late differentiated (CD27-CD28-) CD8 T cell subpopulation was observed in older donors but the CD4/CD8 T cell ratio remained stable in all age groups. Interestingly, the regulatory (CD25hiFOXP3hi) T cell subpopulation was small in all age groups, and we observed no age-associated accumulation of cells expressing the senescence- and exhaustion-associated markers CD57 and PD-1. We assessed functional T cell responses to mitogenic and viral antigenic stimulation by the expression of CD154, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, and IL-17 and proliferation. All responses were robust across the life course, although we observed an age-associated shift from IFN-γ to TNF-α in the response to EBV. In summary, we found the naive T cell subpopulation of young adult Malawians was smaller than in their contemporaries in high-income settings but remains stable thereafter and that lymphocyte function is retained across the life course. These observations indicate that studies of the genetic and environmental factors influencing immune function in different environments may provide insights into minimizing immune ageing.},

However, in countries in which the incidence of tuberculosis is high, contact investigation is not commonly done. Increasing concerns about the failure to meet case-detection targets and about the spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis have prompted a reassessment of the potential benefits of contact investigation. We did a systematic review to determine the yield of household contact investigation. The yield for all tuberculosis (bacteriologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed) was 4.5\% (95\% CI 4.3-4.8, I(2)=95.5\%) of contacts investigated; for cases with bacteriological confirmation the yield was 2.3\% (95\% CI 2.1-2.5, I(2)=96.6\%). Latent tuberculosis infection was found in 51.4\% (95\% CI 50.6-52.2, I(2)=99.4\%) of contacts investigated. The substantial heterogeneity in all analyses indicated high variability among studies that was not accounted for by subgroup analyses. These results suggest that contact investigation merits serious consideration as a means to improve early case detection and decrease transmission of M tuberculosis in high-incidence areas.},

This unit was designed in partnership with managers, clinicians, nurses and patients to address their needs. In this practice piece, we describe a participatory approach to design and implement a sustainable high-dependency unit for a low-income sub-Saharan African setting. This included: prospective agreement on remit, alignment with existing services, refurbishment of a dedicated physical space, recruitment and training of specialist nurses, development of context-sensitive clinical standard operating procedures, purchase of appropriate and durable equipment and creation of digital clinical information systems.

  abstract = {Streptococcus pneumoniae               is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality due to community acquired pneumonia, bacterial meningitis and bacteraemia worldwide. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines protect against invasive disease, but are expensive to manufacture, limited in serotype coverage, associated with serotype replacement and demonstrate reduced effectiveness against mucosal colonisation.~ As asymptomatic colonisation of the human nasopharynx is a prerequisite for pneumococcal disease, this is proposed as a marker for novel vaccine efficacy. Our team established a safe and reproducible pneumococcal controlled human infection model at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM). This has been used to test vaccine induced protection against nasopharyngeal carriage for ten years in over 1000 participants.                          We will transfer established standardised operating procedures from LSTM to Malawi and test in up to 36 healthy participants. Primary endpoint: detection of the inoculated pneumococci by classical culture from nasal wash recovered from the participants after pneumococcal challenge. Secondary endpoints: confirmation of robust clinical and laboratory methods for sample capture and processing. Tertiary endpoints: participant acceptability of study and methods. We will test three doses of pneumococcal inoculation (20,000, 80,000 and 160,000 colony forming units [CFUs] per naris) using a parsimonious study design intended to reduce unnecessary exposure to participants. We hypothesise that 80,000 CFUs will induce nasal colonisation in approximately half of participants per established LSTM practice.                            The aims of the feasibility study are: 1) Establish               Streptococcus pneumoniae               experimental human pneumococcal carriage in Malawi; 2) Confirm optimal nasopharyngeal pneumococcal challenge dose; 3) Confirm safety and measure potential symptoms; 4) Confirm sampling protocols and laboratory assays; 5) Assess feasibility and acceptability of consent and study procedures. Confirmation of pneumococcal controlled human infection model feasibility in Malawi will enable us to target pneumococcal vaccine candidates for an at-risk population who stand the most to gain from new and improved vaccine strategies.},

  abstract = {Background Tuberculosis remains an important clinical and public health issue in South Africa, which has one of the highest tuberculosis burdens in the world. We aimed to estimate the burden of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis among people aged 15 years or older in South Africa. Methods This multistage, cluster-based, cross-sectional survey included eligible residents (age ≥15 years, who had slept in a house for ≥10 nights in the preceding 2 weeks) in 110 clusters nationally (cluster size of 500 people; selected by probability proportional-to-population size sampling). Participants completed face-to-face symptom questionnaires (for cough, weight loss, fever, and night sweats) and manually read digital chest X-ray screening. Screening was recorded as positive if participants had at least one symptom or an abnormal chest X-ray suggestive of tuberculosis, or a combination thereof. Sputum samples from participants who were screen-positive were tested by the Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay (first sample) and Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube culture (second sample), with optional HIV testing. Participants with a positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex culture were considered positive for bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis; when culture was not positive, participants with a positive Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra result with an abnormal chest X-ray suggestive of active tuberculosis and without current or previous tuberculosis were considered positive for bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Findings Between Aug 15, 2017, and July 28, 2019, 68\hphantom{,}771 people were enumerated from 110 clusters, with 53\hphantom{,}250 eligible to participate in the survey, of whom 35\hphantom{,}191 (66·1\%) participated. 9066 (25·8\%) of 35\hphantom{,}191 participants were screen-positive and 234 (0·7\%) were identified as having bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Overall, the estimated prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis was 852 cases (95\% CI 679–1026) per 100\hphantom{,}000 population; the prevalence was highest in people aged 35–44 years (1107 cases [95\% CI 703–1511] per 100\hphantom{,}000 population) and those aged 65 years or older (1104 cases [680–1528] per 100\hphantom{,}000 population). The estimated prevalence was approximately 1·6 times higher in men than in women (1094 cases [95\% CI 835–1352] per 100\hphantom{,}000 population vs 675 cases [494–855] per 100\hphantom{,}000 population). 135 (57·7\%) of 234 participants with tuberculosis screened positive by chest X-ray only, 16 (6·8\%) by symptoms only, and 82 (35·9\%) by both. 55 (28·8\%) of 191 participants with tuberculosis with known HIV status were HIV-positive. Interpretation Pulmonary tuberculosis prevalence in this survey was high, especially in men. Despite the ongoing burden of HIV, many participants with tuberculosis in this survey did not have HIV. As more than half of the participants with tuberculosis had an abnormal chest X-ray without symptoms, prioritising chest X-ray screening could substantially increase case finding.

  abstract = {Background: Human-to-animal transmission of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is reported in South Africa but there is a paucity of epidemiological data. The aim of this One Health manuscript is to describe zooanthroponotic exposure of domestic animals to TB patients, virtually all of whom had laboratory confirmed pulmonary Mtb disease. Methods: This cross-sectional study was nested within two TB contact tracing studies and collected data from 2017 to 2019. TB index patients and their households in three provinces of South Africa were recruited. A questionnaire was administered to households, assessing type and number of animals owned, degree of exposure of animals to humans, and veterinary consultations. For this analysis, we compared descriptive variables by animal-keeping status (animal-keeping vs non-animal keeping households), calculated the chi square and respective p-values. Results: We visited 1766 households with at least one confirmed case of TB, 33\% (587/1766) had livestock or companion animals. Of non-animal-owning households, 2\% (27/1161) cared for other community members' livestock. Few (16\%, 92/587) households kept animals in their dwelling overnight, while 45\% (266/587) kept animals outside the home, but within 10~m of where people slept and ate. Most (81\%, 478/587) of people in animal-owning households were willing for their animal/s to have a TB skin test, but {$<$}1\% (5/587) of animals had been skin-tested; 4\% (24/587) of animal-owning households had a veterinary consultation in the past six months, and 5\% (31/587) reported one of their animals dying from natural causes in the prior six months. Conclusion: Our survey suggests that a high proportion of patients with TB live in settings facilitating close contact with domestic animal species with known susceptibility to Mtb. There is a substantial exposure of household animals to patients with TB and therefore risk of both transmission to, and spillback from animals to humans.},

  abstract = {Background: Community–based screening for tuberculosis (TB) could improve detection but is resource intensive. We set out to evaluate the accuracy of computer–aided TB screening using digital chest X-ray (CXR) to determine if this approach met target product profiles (TPP) for community–based screening. Methods: CXR images from participants in the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey were evaluated using CAD4TBv6 (Delft Imaging), giving a probabilistic score for pulmonary TB ranging from 0 (low probability) to 99 (high probability). We constructed a Bayesian latent class model to estimate the accuracy of CAD4TBv6 screening compared to bacteriologically–confirmed TB across CAD4TBv6 threshold cut–offs, incorporating data on Clinical Officer CXR interpretation, participant demographics (age, sex, TB symptoms, previous TB history), and sputum results. We compared model–estimated sensitivity and specificity of CAD4TBv6 to optimum and minimum TPPs. Results: Of 63,050 prevalence survey participants, 61,848 (98\%) had analysable CXR images, and 8,966 (14.5\%) underwent sputum bacteriological testing; 298 had bacteriologically–confirmed pulmonary TB. Median CAD4TBv6 scores for participants with bacteriologically–confirmed TB were significantly higher (72, IQR: 58–82.75) compared to participants with bacteriologically–negative sputum results (49, IQR: 44–57, p{$<$}0.0001). CAD4TBv6 met the optimum TPP; with the threshold set to achieve a mean sensitivity of 95\% (optimum TPP), specificity was 83.3\%, (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 83.0\%–83.7\%, CAD4TBv6 threshold: 55). There was considerable variation in accuracy by participant characteristics, with older individuals and those with previous TB having lowest specificity. Conclusions: CAD4TBv6 met the optimal TPP for TB community screening. To optimise screening accuracy and efficiency of confirmatory sputum testing, we recommend that an adaptive approach to threshold setting is adopted based on participant characteristics.},

Our aim was to describe and quantify non-TB abnormalities identified by TB-focused CXR screening during the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey.                                         Methods               We reviewed a random sample of 1140 adult (≥15 years) CXRs classified as ‘abnormal, suggestive of TB’ or ‘abnormal other’ during field interpretation from the TB prevalence survey. Each image was read (blinded to field classification and study radiologist read) by two expert radiologists, with images classified into one of four major anatomical categories and primary radiological findings. A third reader resolved discrepancies. Prevalence and 95\% CIs of abnormalities diagnosis were estimated.                                         Findings               Cardiomegaly was the most common non-TB abnormality at 259 out of 1123 (23.1\%, 95\% CI 20.6\% to 25.6\%), while cardiomegaly with features of cardiac failure occurred in 17 out of 1123 (1.5\%, 95\% CI 0.9\% to 2.4\%). We also identified chronic pulmonary pathology including suspected COPD in 3.2\% (95\% CI 2.3\% to 4.4\%) and non-specific patterns in 4.6\% (95\% CI 3.5\% to 6.0\%). Prevalence of active-TB and severe post-TB lung changes was 3.6\% (95\% CI 2.6\% to 4.8\%) and 1.4\% (95\% CI 0.8\% to 2.3\%), respectively.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that HIV-positive adults with CD4 count ≤500 cells/mm(3) initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART). In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, CD4 count is not widely available or consistently used and instead the WHO clinical staging system is used to determine ART eligibility. However, concerns have been raised regarding its discriminatory ability to identify patients eligible to start ART. We therefore reviewed the accuracy of WHO stage 3 or 4 assessment in identifying ART eligibility according to CD4 count thresholds for ART initiation. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Global Health databases and conference abstracts using a comprehensive strategy for studies that compared the results of WHO clinical staging with CD4 count thresholds. Studies performed in sub-Saharan Africa and published in English between 1998 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion according to our predefined study protocol. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were derived for each CD4 count threshold and hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 25,032 participants from 14 countries. Most studies assessed individuals attending ART clinics prior to treatment initiation. WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease had a sensitivity of 60\% (95\% CI: 45-73\%, Q=914.26, p{$<$}0.001) and specificity of 73\% (95\% CI: 60-83\%, Q=1439.43, p{$<$}0.001) for a CD4 threshold of ≤200 cells/mm(3) (11 studies); sensitivity and specificity for a threshold of CD4 count ≤350 cells/mm(3) were 45\% (95\% CI: 26-66\%, Q=1607.31, p{$<$}0.001) and 85\% (95\% CI: 69-93\%, Q=896.70, p{$<$}0.001), respectively (six studies). For the threshold of CD4 count ≤500 cells/mm(3) sensitivity was 14\% (95\% CI: 13-15\%) and specificity was 95\% (95\% CI: 94-96\%) (one study). CONCLUSIONS: When used for individual treatment decisions, WHO clinical staging misses a high proportion of individuals who are ART eligible by CD4 count, with sensitivity falling as CD4 count criteria rises. Access to accurate, accessible, robust and affordable CD4 count testing methods will be a pressing need for as long as ART initiation decisions are based on criteria other than seropositivity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the tuberculosis (TB) situation in the tribal community of Car Nicobar island 15 years after the national TB programme was implemented in this area after an intensive phase of TB control in 1986. METHODS: The entire population of Car Nicobar was enumerated through a house-to-house survey. Children aged {$<$}14 years were tuberculin tested and read for reaction sizes. Individuals aged {$>$}15 years were asked about the presence of chest symptoms (cough, chest pain, and unexplained fever for two weeks or longer and haemoptysis), and sputum samples were collected from patients with chest symptoms. Sputum samples were examined for presence of acid-fast bacilli. FINDINGS: Among the 4,543 children enumerated, 4,351 (95.8\%) were tuberculin tested and read. Of the 981 children without bacille Calmette-Guerin scars, 161 (16.4\%) were infected with TB. A total of 77 cases who were smear-positive for TB were detected from among 10,570 people aged {$>$}15 years; the observed smear-positive case prevalence was 728.5 per 100,000. The standardized prevalence of TB infection, annual risk of TB infection, and prevalence of cases smear-positive for TB were 17.0\%, 2.5\%, and 735.3 per 100,000, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TB infection and smear-positive cases of TB increased significantly between 1986 and 2002. Such escalation took place despite the implementation of the national TB programme on this island, which was preceded by a set of special anti-TB measures that resulted in sputum conversion in a substantially large proportion of the smear-positive cases prevalent in the community. The most likely reason for the increase seems to be the absence of a district TB programme with enough efficiency to sustain the gains made from the one-time initial phase of special anti-TB measures. High risk of transmission of TB infection currently observed on this island calls for a drastic and sustained improvement in TB control measures.},

  abstract = {Background: While tuberculosis incidence and mortality are declining in South Africa, meeting the goals of the End TB Strategy requires an invigorated programmatic response informed by accurate data. Enumerating the losses at each step in the care cascade enables appropriate targeting of interventions and resources. Methods: We estimated the tuberculosis burden; the number and proportion of individuals with tuberculosis who accessed tests, had tuberculosis diagnosed, initiated treatment, and successfully completed treatment for all tuberculosis cases, for those with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-coinfected cases) and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. Estimates were derived from national electronic tuberculosis register data, laboratory data, and published studies. Results: The overall tuberculosis burden was estimated to be 532005 cases (range, 333760-764480 cases), with successful completion of treatment in 53\% of cases. Losses occurred at multiple steps: 5\% at test access, 13\% at diagnosis, 12\% at treatment initiation, and 17\% at successful treatment completion. Overall losses were similar among all drug-susceptible cases and those with HIV coinfection (54\% and 52\%, respectively, successfully completed treatment). Losses were substantially higher among rifampicin- resistant cases, with only 22\% successfully completing treatment. Conclusion: Although the vast majority of individuals with tuberculosis engaged the public health system, just over half were successfully treated. Urgent efforts are required to improve implementation of existing policies and protocols to close gaps in tuberculosis diagnosis, treatment initiation, and successful treatment completion.},

OBJECTIVE: To find and compare the prevalence of bacillary positive pulmonary tuberculosis amongst the different tribes and in the non-tribal population. DESIGN: Prevalence study of pulmonary tuberculosis by house-to-house survey of symptoms among tribal (n = 20596) and non-tribal (n = 93 670) populations aged 5 years and over, between September 1989 and November 1990. RESULTS: The prevalence of smear and/or culture-positive tuberculosis/100000 population was 133 in the tribal and 144 in the non-tribal population. The difference in prevalence of symptomatic individuals and sputum-positive cases among the tribal and the non-tribal populations was statistically significant only in the symptomatic individuals/100000 (P = 0.01). The prevalence of cases in both groups was higher in males than females; however this difference was significant only in the tribal group (P = 0.05). Only two of the 46 tribes encountered, the Mana and Pawara tribes, showed a high prevalence, of 730 and 612/100000, respectively. The three other tribes with positive cases (the Gond group) had prevalences comparable to that of the nontribal population. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of tuberculosis in tribal people was comparable to that of the non-tribal population.},

Triage tests are simple and low-cost tests aiming to improve ease of access and implementation (compared with confirmatory tests) and decrease the proportion of patients requiring more expensive confirmatory testing. Evaluation of triage tests should occur in settings of intended use, such as community and primary healthcare centers. Important considerations for triage test evaluation include study design, population, sample type, test throughput, use of thresholds, reference standard (ideally culture), and specimen flow. The impact of a triage test will depend heavily on issues beyond accuracy, primarily centered on implementation.},

  abstract = {Vietnam, a high tuberculosis (TB) burden country, conducted national TB prevalence surveys in 2007 and 2017. In both surveys participants were screened by using a questionnaire and chest radiograph; sputum samples were then collected to test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis by smear microscopy and Löwenstein-Jensen culture. Culture-positive, smear-positive, and smear-negative TB cases were defined by laboratory results, and the prevalence of tuberculosis was compared between the 2 surveys. The results showed prevalence of culture-positive TB decreased by 37\% (95\% CI 11.5\%-55.4\%), from 199 (95\% CI 160-248) cases/100,000 adults in 2007 to 125 (95\% CI 98-159) cases/100,000 adults in 2017. Prevalence of smear-positive TB dropped by 53\% (95\% CI 27.0\%-69.7\%), from 99 (95\% CI 78-125) cases/100,000 adults to 46 (95\% CI 32-68) cases/100,000 adults; smear-negative TB showed no substantial decrease. Replacing microscopy with molecular methods for primary diagnostics might enhance diagnosis of pulmonary TB cases and further lower TB burden.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many parts of Africa have witnessed reductions in Plasmodium falciparum transmission over the last 15\,years. Since immunity to malaria is acquired more rapidly at higher transmission, the slower acquisition of immunity at lower transmission may partially offset the benefits of reductions in transmission. We examined the clinical spectrum of disease and predictors of mortality after sustained changes in transmission intensity, using data collected from 1989 to 2016. METHODS: We conducted a temporal observational analysis of 18,000 children, aged 14\,days to 14\,years old, who were admitted to Kilifi County Hospital, Kenya, from 1989 to 2016 with malaria. We describe the trends over time of the clinical and laboratory criteria for severe malaria and associated risk of mortality. RESULTS: During the time periods 1989-2003, 2004-2008, and 2009-2016, Kilifi County Hospital admitted averages of 657, 310, and 174 cases of severe malaria per year including averages of 48, 14, and 12 malaria-associated deaths per year, respectively. The median ages in years of children admitted with cerebral malaria, severe anaemia, and malaria-associated mortality were 3.0 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.2-3.9), 1.1 (95\% CI 0.9-1.4), and 1.1 (95\% CI 0.3-2.2) in the year 1989, rising to 4.9 (95\% CI 3.9-5.9), 3.8 (95\% CI 2.5-7.1), and 5 (95\% CI 3.3-6.3) in the year 2016. The ratio of children with cerebral malaria to severe anaemia rose from 1:2 before 2004 to 3:2 after 2009. Hyperparasitaemia was a risk factor for death after 2009 but not in earlier time periods. CONCLUSION: Despite the evidence of slower acquisition of immunity, continued reductions in the numbers of cases of severe malaria resulted in lower overall mortality. Our temporal data are limited to a single site, albeit potentially applicable to a secular trend present in many parts of Africa.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: HIV and tuberculosis (TB) remain leading causes of preventable death in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HIV testing for all individuals with TB symptoms, but implementation has been suboptimal. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analyses to estimate HIV and TB prevalence, and short-term (two to six~months) mortality, among adults with TB symptoms at community- and facility level. METHODS: We searched Embase, Global Health and MEDLINE databases, and reviewed conference abstracts for studies reporting simultaneous HIV and TB screening of adults in LMICs published between January 2003 and December 2017. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate prevalence of HIV, undiagnosed TB and mortality risk at different health system levels. RESULTS: Sixty-two studies including 260,792 symptomatic adults were identified, mostly from Africa and Asia. Median HIV prevalence was 19.2\% (IQR: 8.3\% to 40.4\%) at community level, 55.7\% (IQR: 20.9\% to 71.2\%) at primary care level and 80.7\% (IQR: 73.8\% to 84.6\%) at hospital level. Median TB prevalence was 6.9\% (IQR: 3.3\% to 8.4\%) at community, 20.5\% (IQR: 11.7\% to 46.4\%) at primary care and 36.4\% (IQR: 22.9\% to 40.9\%) at hospital level. Median short-term mortality was 22.6\% (IQR: 15.6\% to 27.7\%) among inpatients, 3.1\% (IQR: 1.2\% to 4.2\%) at primary care and 1.6\% (95\% CI: 0.45 to 4.13, n~=~1 study) at community level. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with TB symptoms have extremely high prevalence of HIV infection, even when identified through community surveys. TB prevalence and mortality increased substantially at primary care and inpatient level respectively. Strategies to expand symptom-based TB screening combined with HIV and TB testing for all symptomatic individuals should be of the highest priority for both disease programmes in LMICs with generalized HIV epidemics. Interventions to reduce short-term mortality are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current tuberculosis diagnostics lack sensitivity, and are expensive. Highly accurate, rapid and cheaper diagnostic tests are required for point of care use in low resource settings with high HIV prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the sensitivity and specificity, and cost of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for tuberculosis diagnosis in adults with chronic cough compared to Xpert® MTB/RIF, fluorescence smear microscopy. METHODS: Between October 2013 and March 2014, consecutive adults at a primary care clinic were screened for cough, offered HIV testing and assessed for tuberculosis using LAMP, Xpert® MTB/RIF and fluorescence smear microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity (with culture as reference standard), and costs were estimated. RESULTS: Of 273 adults recruited, 44.3\% (121/273) were HIV-positive and 19.4\% (53/273) had bacteriogically confirmed tuberculosis. The sensitivity of LAMP compared to culture was 65.0\% (95\% CI: 48.3\% to 79.4\%) with 100\% (95\% CI: 98.0\% to 100\%) specificity. The sensitivity of Xpert® MTB/RIF (77.5\%, 95\% CI: 61.5\% to 89.2\%) was similar to that of LAMP, p = 0.132. The sensitivity of concentrated fluorescence smear microscopy with routine double reading (87.5\%, 95\% CI: 73.2\% to 95.8\%) was higher than that of LAMP, p = 0.020. All three tests had high specificity. The lowest cost per test of LAMP was at batch size of 14 samples (US\$ 9.98); this was lower than Xpert® MTB/RIF (US\$ 13.38) but higher than fluorescence smear microscopy (US\$ 0.65). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of LAMP was similar to Xpert® MTB/RIF but lower than fluorescence smear microscopy; all three tests had high specificity. These findings support the Malawi policy that recommends a combination of fluorescence smear microscopy and Xpert® MTB/RIF prioritised for people living with HIV, already found to be smear-negative, or being considered for retreatment of tuberculosis.},

However, its proximity with ethical concerns of coercion, undue influence, and exploitation, demand that participant compensation be regulated. The objective of this paper is to discuss the current regulations for compensation of research participants in Malawi and how they can be improved in relation to ethical concerns of coercion, undue influence, and exploitation. MAIN TEXT: In Malawi, national regulations recommend that research subjects be compensated with a stipend of US\$10 per study visit. However, no guidance is provided on how this figure was determined and how it should be implemented. While necessary to prevent exploitation, the stipend may expose the very poor to undue influence. The stipend may also raise the cost of doing research disadvantaging local researchers and may have implications on studies where income stipend is the intervention under investigation. We recommend that development and implementation of guidelines of this importance involve interested parties such as the research community and patient groups. CONCLUSION: Compensating human research subjects is important but can also act as a barrier to voluntary participation and good research efforts. Deliberate measures need to be put in place to ensure fair compensation of research participants, avoid their exploitation and level the field for locally funded research.},

METHODS: A follow-up study consisting of two parts--a register match of notified TB cases with 22,160 participants in a national TB prevalence survey, and a repeat medical examination for the subjects of a prevalence survey with abnormal findings on CXR--was conducted 2 years after the prevalence survey in Cambodia. RESULTS: Thirty-four cases with new smear-positive TB were detected by register match, giving a standardised notification ratio of 0.38 (95\%CI 0.27-0.52). An additional seven new smear-positive TB cases and 93 new smear-negative, culture-positive TB cases were detected by medical examination. The incidence rates of bacteriologically positive TB were 8.5\% per year (95\%CI 6.3-11.2) in cases with a CXR suggestive of active TB and 2.9\% per year (95\%CI 2.2-3.7) in those with a CXR with other abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Detection and treatment of smear-negative, culture-positive TB cases as well as smear-positive TB cases was associated with a rapid reduction in subsequent incidence of new smear-positive TB. Sputum culture-negative individuals with abnormal CXR findings are at a high risk of disease progression, and require follow-up and potentially preventive treatment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many low and middle-income countries are experiencing colliding epidemics of chronic infectious (ID) and non-communicable diseases (NCD). As a result, the prevalence of multiple morbidities (MM) is rising. METHODS: We conducted a study to describe the epidemiology of MM in a primary care clinic in Khayelitsha. Adults with at least one of HIV, tuberculosis (TB), diabetes (DM), and hypertension (HPT) were identified between Sept 2012-May 2013 on electronic databases. Using unique patient identifiers, drugs prescribed across all facilities in the province were linked to each patient and each drug class assigned a condition. RESULTS: These 4 diseases accounted for 45\% of all prescription visits. Among 14364 chronic disease patients, HPT was the most common morbidity (65\%). 22.6\% of patients had MM, with an increasing prevalence with age; and a high prevalence among younger antiretroviral therapy (ART) patients (26\% and 30\% in 18-35 yr and 36-45 year age groups respectively). Among these younger ART patients with MM, HPT and DM prevalence was higher than in those not on ART. CONCLUSIONS: We highlight the co-existence of multiple ID and NCD. This presents both challenges (increasing complexity and the impact on health services, providers and patients), and opportunities for chronic diseases screening in a population linked to care. It also necessitates re-thinking of models of health care delivery and requires policy interventions to integrate and coordinate management of co-morbid chronic diseases.},

Numerous randomized trials have required changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but guidance for reporting such modifications is incomplete. Objective: As a joint extension for the CONSORT and SPIRIT reporting guidelines, CONSERVE (CONSORT and SPIRIT Extension for RCTs Revised in Extenuating Circumstances) aims to improve reporting of trial protocols and completed trials that undergo important modifications in response to extenuating circumstances. Evidence: A panel of 37 international trial investigators, patient representatives, methodologists and statisticians, ethicists, funders, regulators, and journal editors convened to develop the guideline. The panel developed CONSERVE following an accelerated, iterative process between June 2020 and February 2021 involving (1) a rapid literature review of multiple databases (OVID Medline, OVID EMBASE, and EBSCO CINAHL) and gray literature sources from 2003 to March 2021; (2) consensus-based panelist meetings using a modified Delphi process and surveys; and (3) a global survey of trial stakeholders. Findings: The rapid review yielded 41\,673 citations, of which 38 titles were relevant, including emerging guidance from regulatory and funding agencies for managing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on trials. However, no generalizable guidance for all circumstances in which trials and trial protocols might face unanticipated modifications were identified. The CONSERVE panel used these findings to develop a consensus reporting guidelines following 4 rounds of meetings and surveys. Responses were received from 198 professionals from 34 countries, of whom 90\% (n\,=\,178) indicated that they understood the concept definitions and 85.4\% (n\,=\,169) indicated that they understood and could use the implementation tool. Feedback from survey respondents was used to finalize the guideline and confirm that the guideline's core concepts were applicable and had utility for the trial community. CONSERVE incorporates an implementation tool and checklists tailored to trial reports and trial protocols for which extenuating circumstances have resulted in important modifications to the intended study procedures. The checklists include 4 sections capturing extenuating circumstances, important modifications, responsible parties, and interim data analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: CONSERVE offers an extension to CONSORT and SPIRIT that could improve the transparency, quality, and completeness of reporting important modifications to trials in extenuating circumstances such as COVID-19.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a health systems intervention to strengthen management for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in household contacts of confirmed tuberculosis cases.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}ACT4 was a cluster-randomised, open-label trial involving 24 health facilities in Benin, Canada, Ghana, Indonesia, and Vietnam randomly assigned to either a three-phase intervention (LTBI programme evaluation, local decision making, and strengthening activities) or control (standard LTBI care). Tuberculin and isoniazid were provided to control and intervention sites if not routinely available. Randomisation was stratified by country and restricted to ensure balance of index patients with tuberculosis by arm and country. The primary outcome was the number of household contacts who initiated tuberculosis preventive treatment at each health facility within 4 months of the diagnosis of the index case, recorded in the first or last 6 months of our 20-month study. To ease interpretation, this number was standardised per 100 newly diagnosed index patients with tuberculosis. Analysis was by intention to treat. Masking of staff at the coordinating centre and sites was not possible; however, those analysing data were masked to assignment of intervention or control. An economic analysis of the intervention was done in parallel with the trial. ACT4 is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02810678.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The study was done between Aug 1, 2016, and March 31, 2019. During the first 6 months of the study the crude overall proportion of household contacts initiating tuberculosis preventive treatment out of those eligible at intervention sites was 0·21. After the implementation of programme strengthening activities, the proportion initiating tuberculosis preventive treatment increased to 0·35. Overall, the number of household contacts initiating tuberculosis preventive treatment per 100 index patients with tuberculosis increased between study phases in intervention sites (adjusted rate difference 60, 95\% CI 4 to 116), while control sites showed no statistically significant change (−12, −33 to 10). There was a difference in rate differences of 72 (95\% CI 10 to 134) contacts per 100 index patients with tuberculosis initiating preventive treatment associated with the intervention. The total cost for the intervention, plus LTBI clinical care per additional contact initiating treatment was estimated to be CA\$1348 (range 724 to 9708).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}A strategy of standardised evaluation, local decision making, and implementation of health systems strengthening activities can provide a mechanism for scale-up of tuberculosis prevention, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Canadian Institutes of Health Research{$<$}/p{$>$}},

DESIGN: We searched four databases for articles published between January 2010 and December 2015 comparing CAD of PTB on CXR to a microbiologic reference standard (smear, culture or polymerase chain reaction). We collected and summarised data on study design, CAD software and diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve [AUC]). RESULTS: We included 5 of 455 articles identified by searching databases. PTB prevalence ranged from 18\% to 60\%, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence from 33\% to 68\%. All articles evaluated CAD4TB, the only commercially available software. AUC ranged from 0.71 to 0.84. Software settings that increased sensitivity resulted in important reductions in specificity, and vice versa. Risk of bias was low in prospective studies (n = 2), and high in retrospective studies (n = 3). CONCLUSION: Evidence assessing CAD's diagnostic accuracy is limited by the small number of studies, most of which have important methodological limitations, the availability and evaluation of only one software programme, and limited generalisability to settings where PTB and HIV are less prevalent. Additional research is required.},

  abstract = {Background:~Tuberculosis (TB) is predominantly an airborne disease. However, quantitative and qualitative analysis of bio-aerosols containing the aetiological agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), has proven very challenging. Our objective is to sample bio-aerosols from newly diagnosed TB patients for detection and enumeration of Mtb bacilli. Methods:~We monitored each of 35 newly diagnosed, GeneXpert sputum-positive, TB patients during 1 hour confinement in a custom-built Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber (RASC). The RASC (a small clean-room of 1.4m ) incorporates aerodynamic particle size detection, viable and non-viable sampling devices, real-time CO 2 monitoring, and cough sound-recording. Microbiological culture and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) were used to detect Mtb in each of the bio-aerosol collection devices. Results:~ Mtb was detected in 27/35 (77.1\%) of aerosol samples; 15/35 (42.8\%) samples were positive by mycobacterial culture and 25/27 (92.96\%) were positive by ddPCR. Culturability of collected bacilli was not predicted by radiographic evidence of pulmonary cavitation, sputum smear positivity. A correlation was found between cough rate and culturable bioaerosol.~ Mtb was detected on all viable cascade impactor stages with a peak at aerosol sizes 2.0-3.5μm. This suggests a median of 0.09 CFU/litre of exhaled air (IQR: 0.07 to 0.3 CFU/l) for the aerosol culture positives and an estimated median concentration of 4.5x10 CFU/ml (IQR: 2.9x10 -5.6x10 ) of exhaled particulate bio-aerosol. Conclusions:~ Mtb was identified in bio-aerosols exhaled by the majority of untreated TB patients using the RASC. Molecular detection was more sensitive than mycobacterial culture on solid media, suggesting that further studies are required to determine whether this reflects a significant proportion of differentially detectable~bacilli in these samples.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Men have a higher prevalence of undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) than women and can spend up to a year longer contributing to ongoing transmission in the community before receiving treatment. Health outcomes are often worse for patients with TB living in informal settlements especially men. This study aimed to understand the barriers preventing men from seeking care for TB and cocreate interventions to address these barriers. METHODS: We used qualitative research methods including in-depth interviews and participatory workshops. Researchers worked with women and men living in Bangwe, an informal settlement in Blantyre, Malawi to develop interventions that reflected their lived realities. The study took place over two phases, in the first phase we undertook interviews with men and women to explore barrier to care seeking, in the second phase we used participatory workshops to cocreate interventions to address barriers and followed up on issues emerging from the workshops with further interviews. In total, 30 interviews were conducted, and 23 participants joined participatory workshops. The team used a thematic analysis to analyse the data. RESULTS: Three interconnected thematic areas shaped men's health TB seeking behaviour: precarious socioeconomic conditions; gendered social norms; and constraints in the health system. Insecurity of day labour with no provision for sick leave; pressure to provide for the household and a gendered desire not to appear weak and a severely under-resourced health system all contributed to men delaying care in this context. Identified interventions included improved patient-provider relations within the health-system, improved workers' health rights and broader social support for households. CONCLUSION: Improving mens' pathways to care requires interventions that consider contextual issues by addressing individual level socioeconomic factors but also broader structural factors of gendered social dynamics and health systems environment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children younger than 5 years. In this study, we estimated causes of pneumonia in young African and Asian children, using novel analytical methods applied to clinical and microbiological findings. METHODS: We did a multi-site, international case-control study in nine study sites in seven countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. All sites enrolled in the study for 24 months. Cases were children aged 1-59 months admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41·8\% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99·7\% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (31·7\%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10·6-97·3\%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6·4\% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3·2\%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33·9\%] of 56). Almost all cases (98·9\%) and controls (98·0\%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), H influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status. The aetiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 61·4\% (95\% credible interval [CrI] 57·3-65·6) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 27·3\% (23·3-31·6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5·9\% (3·9-8·3). Viruses were less common (54·5\%, 95\% CrI 47·4-61·5 vs 68·0\%, 62·7-72·7) and bacteria more common (33·7\%, 27·2-40·8 vs 22·8\%, 18·3-27·6) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (31·1\%, 95\% CrI 28·4-34·2) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5\% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirus-enterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79\% or more of the site's aetiological fraction. INTERPRETATION: In our study, a small set of pathogens accounted for most cases of pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Preventing and treating a subset of pathogens could substantially affect childhood pneumonia outcomes. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Cryptococcal meningitis is responsible for around 15\% of all HIV-related deaths globally. Conventional treatment courses with amphotericin B require prolonged hospitalisation and are associated with multiple toxicities and poor outcomes. A phase II study has shown that a single high dose of liposomal amphotericin may be comparable to standard treatment. We propose a phase III clinical endpoint trial comparing single, high-dose liposomal amphotericin with the WHO recommended first-line treatment at six sites across five counties. An economic analysis is essential to support wide-scale implementation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Country-specific economic evaluation tools will be developed across the five country settings. Details of patient and household out-of-pocket expenses and any catastrophic healthcare expenditure incurred will be collected via interviews from trial patients. Health service patient costs and related household expenditure in both arms will be compared over the trial period in a probabilistic approach, using Monte Carlo bootstrapping methods. Costing information and number of life-years survived will be used as the input to a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a single, high-dose liposomal amphotericin to the standard treatment. In addition, these results will be compared with a historical cohort from another clinical trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The AMBIsome Therapy Induction OptimisatioN (AMBITION) trial has been evaluated and approved by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of Botswana, Malawi National Health Sciences, University of Cape Town, Mulago Hospital and Zimbabwe Medical Research Council research ethics committees. All participants will provide written informed consent or if lacking capacity will have consent provided by a proxy. The findings of this economic analysis, part of the AMBITION trial, will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and at international and country-level policy meetings.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid on-site diagnosis facilitates tuberculosis control. Performing Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) at point of care is feasible, even when performed by minimally trained health-care workers, and when compared with point-of-care smear microscopy, reduces time to diagnosis and pretreatment loss to follow-up. However, whether Xpert is cost-effective at point of care remains unclear. METHODS: We empirically collected cost (US\$, 2014) and clinical outcome data from participants presenting to primary health-care facilities in four African countries (South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Tanzania) during the TB-NEAT trial. Costs were determined using an bottom-up ingredients approach. Effectiveness measures from the trial included number of cases diagnosed, initiated on treatment, and completing treatment. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness of point-of-care Xpert relative to smear microscopy. The study was performed from the perspective of the health-care provider. FINDINGS: Using data from 1502 patients, we calculated that the mean Xpert unit cost was lower when performed at a centralised laboratory (Lab Xpert) rather than at point of care (\$23·00 [95\% CI 22·12-23·88] vs \$28·03 [26·19-29·87]). Per 1000 patients screened, and relative to smear microscopy, point-of-care Xpert cost an additional \$35\hphantom{,}529 (27\hphantom{,}054-40\hphantom{,}025) and was associated with an additional 24·3 treatment initiations ([-20·0 to 68·5]; \$1464 per treatment), 63·4 same-day treatment initiations ([27·3-99·4]; \$511 per same-day treatment), and 29·4 treatment completions ([-6·9 to 65·6]; \$1211 per completion). Xpert costs were most sensitive to test volume, whereas incremental outcomes were most sensitive to the number of patients initiating and completing treatment. The probability of point-of-care Xpert being cost-effective was 90\% at a willingness to pay of \$3820 per treatment completion. INTERPRETATION: In southern Africa, although point-of-care Xpert unit cost is higher than Lab Xpert, it is likely to offer good value for money relative to smear microscopy. With the current availability of point-of-care nucleic acid amplification platforms (eg, Xpert Edge), these data inform much needed investment and resource allocation strategies in tuberculosis endemic settings.

This study investigated whether BCG alters all-cause infectious disease morbidity in healthy infants in a different high-mortality setting, and explored whether the changes are mediated via trained innate immunity. METHODS: This was an investigator-blind, randomised, controlled trial done at one hospital in Entebbe, Uganda. Infants who were born unwell (ie, those who were not well enough to be discharged directly home from the labour ward because they required medical intervention), with major congenital malformations, to mothers with HIV, into families with known or suspected tuberculosis, or for whom cord blood samples could not be taken, were excluded from the study. Any other infant well enough to be discharged directly from the labour ward was eligible for inclusion, with no limitation on gestational age or birthweight. Participants were recruited at birth and randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard dose BCG 1331 (BCG-Danish) on the day of birth or at age 6 weeks (computer-generated randomisation, block sizes of 24, stratified by sex). Investigators and clinicians were masked to group assignment; parents were not masked. Participants were clinically followed up to age 10 weeks and contributed blood samples to one of three immunological substudies. The primary clinical outcome was physician-diagnosed non-tuberculous infectious disease incidence. Primary immunological outcomes were histone trimethylation at the promoter region of TNF, IL6, and IL1B; ex-vivo production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and IFNγ after heterologous stimulation; and transferrin saturation and hepcidin levels. All outcomes were analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population of all randomly assigned participants except those whose for whom consent was withdrawn. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number registry (\#59683017). FINDINGS: Between Sept 25, 2014, and July 31, 2015, 560 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive BCG at birth (n=280) or age 6 weeks (n=280). 12 participants assigned to receive BCG at birth and 11 participants assigned to receive BCG at age 6 weeks were withdrawn from the study by their parents shortly after randomisation and were not included in analyses. During the first 6 weeks of life before the infants in the delayed vaccination group received BCG vaccination, physician-diagnosed non-tuberculous infectious disease incidence was lower in infants in the BCG at birth group than in the delayed group (98 presentations in the BCG at birth group vs 129 in the delayed BCG group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·71 [95\% CI 0·53-0·95], p=0·023). After BCG in the delayed group (ie, during the age 6-10 weeks follow-up), there was no significant difference in non-tuberculous infectious disease incidence between the groups (88 presentations vs 76 presentations; HR 1·10 [0·87-1·40], p=0·62). BCG at birth inhibited the increase in histone trimethylation at the TNF promoter in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurring in the first 6 weeks of life. H3K4me3 geometric mean fold-increases were 3·1 times lower at the TNF promoter (p=0·018), 2·5 times lower at the IL6 promoter (p=0·20), and 3·1 times lower at the IL1B promoter (p=0·082) and H3K9me3 geometric mean fold-increases were 8·9 times lower at the TNF promoter (p=0·0046), 1·2 times lower at the IL6 promoter (p=0·75), and 4·6 times lower at the IL1B promoter (p=0·068), in BCG-vaccinated (BCG at birth group) versus BCG-naive (delayed BCG group) infants. No clear effect of BCG on ex-vivo production of TNF, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and IFNγ after heterologous stimulation, or transferrin saturation and hepcidin concentration, was detected (geometric mean ratios between 0·68 and 1·68; p≥0·038 for all comparisons). INTERPRETATION: BCG vaccination protects against non-tuberculous infectious disease during the neonatal period, in addition to having tuberculosis-specific effects. Prioritisation of BCG on the first day of life in high-mortality settings might have significant public-health benefits through reductions in all-cause infectious morbidity and mortality.

  abstract = {SETTING: The Agincourt demographic and health surveillance site in South Africa's rural Northern Province. OBJECTIVES: To accurately assess the true burden of tuberculosis in a rural sub-district with a known high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus. DESIGN: Data on hospital registrations of tuberculosis were combined with data from an ongoing demographic health and surveillance system to accurately describe the burden of tuberculosis in a well-defined community. Undiagnosed active cases of sputum-positive disease in the community were detected among chronic coughers identified by heads of household during a single-pass census interview. RESULTS: The incidence of hospitalised tuberculosis among the permanently resident population (n = 56 566) was 212/100,000 person-years during 1999. The average point prevalence of detected tuberculosis (all forms) among patients aged over 10 years was 133/100,000, and 81/100,000 for sputum-positive pulmonary disease. This compares with a point prevalence of 16/100,000 cases of sputum-positive disease detected through active case finding. CONCLUSION: For every nine cases of sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis being treated at any one time, there are two cases of undiagnosed disease in the community. This study demonstrates a modest burden of undiagnosed tuberculosis among residents in a rural sub-district in South Africa.},

No published studies have compared multiple DL systems and populations. We conducted a retrospective evaluation of three DL systems (CAD4TB, Lunit INSIGHT, and qXR) for detecting TB-associated abnormalities in chest radiographs from outpatients in Nepal and Cameroon. All 1196 individuals received a Xpert MTB/RIF assay and a CXR read by two groups of radiologists and the DL systems. Xpert was used as the reference standard. The area under the curve of the three systems was similar: Lunit (0.94, 95\% CI: 0.93-0.96), qXR (0.94, 95\% CI: 0.92-0.97) and CAD4TB (0.92, 95\% CI: 0.90-0.95). When matching the sensitivity of the radiologists, the specificities of the DL systems were significantly higher except for one. Using DL systems to read CXRs could reduce the number of Xpert MTB/RIF tests needed by 66\% while maintaining sensitivity at 95\% or better. Using a universal cutoff score resulted different performance in each site, highlighting the need to select scores based on the population screened. These DL systems should be considered by TB programs where human resources are constrained, and automated technology is available.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study trends in the prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis in south India. METHODS: In 1968-1970, about 100,000 subjects were surveyed for tuberculosis and followed thereafter for 15 years, mainly by repeat survey once every 2.5 years. New entrants were inducted at every repeat survey. Radiographic examination of subjects aged 5 years or more and sputum smear and culture examinations of those with an abnormal shadow were undertaken; tuberculin tests were done initially on all, and at 4, 10 and 15 years in selected samples of those aged 1-9 years. RESULTS: The prevalence of culture-positive tuberculosis decreased by 1.4\% per annum to 694/100,000, while that of smear-positive tuberculosis showed no significant decrease from 457/100,000. The annual incidence of culture-positive tuberculosis decreased by 4.3\%/annum to 189/100,000 and that of smear-positive tuberculosis decreased by 2.3\%/annum to 113/100,000. Decreases in incidence occurred exclusively in those with abnormal radiographic findings suggestive of tuberculosis at the start of the period. The annual risk of tuberculosis infection (ARTI) was initially 2\%, and showed no sign of decline over the period. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of tuberculosis and ARTI showed little or no decrease over the 15-year period. A significant decrease in incidence occurred, but exclusively in those with abnormal radiograph suggestive of tuberculosis at the start of the period.},

Our objective was to use the geospatial technology to map age and time standardized HIV incidence rates over a period of 10\,years to identify communities at high risk of HIV in the greater Durban area. METHODS: HIV incidence rates from 7557 South African women enrolled in five community-based HIV prevention trials (2002-2012) were mapped using participant household global positioning system (GPS) coordinates. Age and period standardized HIV incidence rates were calculated for 43 recruitment clusters across greater Durban. Bayesian conditional autoregressive areal spatial regression (CAR) was used to identify significant patterns and clustering of new HIV infections in recruitment communities. RESULTS: The total person-time in the cohort was 9093.93\,years and 613 seroconversions were observed. The overall crude HIV incidence rate across all communities was 6·74 per 100PY (95\% CI: 6·22-7·30). 95\% of the clusters had HIV incidence rates greater than 3 per 100PY. The CAR analysis identified six communities with significantly high HIV incidence. Estimated relative risks for these clusters ranged from 1.34 to 1.70. Consistent with these results, age standardized HIV incidence rates were also highest in these clusters and estimated to be 10 or more per 100 PY. Compared to women 35+ years old younger women were more likely to reside in the highest incidence areas (aOR: 1·51, 95\% CI: 1·06-2·15; aOR: 1.59, 95\% CI: 1·19-2·14 and aOR: 1·62, 95\% CI: 1·2-2·18 for {$<$}\,20, 20-24, 25-29\,years old respectively). Partnership factors (2+ sex partners and being unmarried/not cohabiting) were also more common in the highest incidence clusters (aOR 1.48, 95\% CI: 1.25-1.75 and aOR 1.54, 95\% CI: 1.28-1.84 respectively). CONCLUSION: Fine geospatial analysis showed a continuous, unrelenting, hyper HIV epidemic in most of the greater Durban region with six communities characterised by particularly high levels of HIV incidence. The results motivate for comprehensive community-based HIV prevention approaches including expanded access to PrEP. In addition, a higher concentration of HIV related services is required in the highest risk communities to effectively reach the most vulnerable populations.},

  abstract = {The billions of people with latent tuberculosis infection serve as the seedbeds for future cases of active tuberculosis. Virtually all episodes of tuberculosis disease are preceded by a period of asymptomatic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; therefore, identifying infected individuals most likely to progress to disease and treating such subclinical infections to prevent future disease provides a crucial opportunity to interrupt tuberculosis transmission and reduce the global burden of tuberculosis disease. Programmes focusing on single strategies rather than comprehensive programmes that deliver an integrated arsenal for tuberculosis control might continue to struggle. Tuberculosis preventive therapy is a poorly used method that is essential for controlling the reservoirs of disease that drive the epidemic. Comprehensive control strategies that combine preventive therapy for the most high-risk populations and communities with improved case-finding and treatment, control of transmission, and health systems strengthening could ultimately lead to worldwide tuberculosis elimination. In this Series paper we outline challenges to implementation of preventive therapy and provide pragmatic suggestions for overcoming them. We further advocate for tuberculosis preventive therapy as the core of a renewed worldwide focus to implement a comprehensive epidemic control strategy that would reduce new tuberculosis cases to elimination targets. This strategy would be underpinned by accelerated research to further understand the biology of subclinical tuberculosis infections, develop novel diagnostics and drug regimens specifically for subclinical tuberculosis infection, strengthen health systems and community engagement, and enhance sustainable large scale implementation of preventive therapy programmes.},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A community based cross-sectional survey was undertaken in Jabalpur District of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. A stratified cluster sampling design was adopted to select the sample. All eligible individuals were questioned for pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB disease. Two sputum samples were collected from all eligible individuals and were examined by Ziehl-Neelsen smear microscopy and solid media culture methods. Of the 99,918 individuals eligible for screening, 95,071 (95.1\%) individuals were screened. Of these, 7,916 (8.3\%) were found to have symptoms and sputum was collected from 7,533 (95.2\%) individuals. Overall prevalence of bacteriologically positive PTB was found to be 255.3 per 100,000 population (95\% C.I: 195.3-315.4). Prevalence was significantly higher (p{$<$}0.001) amongst males (355.8; 95\% C.I: 304.4-413.4) compared with females (109.0; 95\% C.I: 81.2-143.3). Prevalence was also significantly higher in rural areas (348.9; 95\% C.I: 292.6-412.8) as compared to the urban (153.9; 95\% C.I: 123.2-190.1). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The TB situation in Jabalpur district, central India, is observed to be comparable to the TB situation at the national level (255.3 versus 249). There is however, a need to maintain and further strengthen TB control measures on a sustained and long term basis in the area to have a significant impact on the disease prevalence in the community.},

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and incidence of microscopy positive patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. DESIGN: The entire population of 22,847 was covered prospectively; the prevalence survey in 1981 was conducted through house to house interviews followed by collecting and examining sputum specimens by microscopy from symptomatic patients (cough for more than 2 weeks duration or other respiratory or systemic symptoms compatible with tuberculosis). The prevalence survey was followed by monthly visits for two consecutive years to obtain an accurate estimate of the incidence. RESULTS: The prevalence in the population among persons aged 10 years and above was 2.41 per 1000, the average annual incidence during 1981-83 was 1.11 per 1000 or 46\% of the prevalence. The male:female ratio in the prevalence survey was 2.6:1, while in the incidence assessment it was 2.4:1. CONCLUSION: The results of the study provide valuable information on the relation between prevalence and incidence of sputum smear-positive cases which should help to better our understanding of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in a disadvantaged part of the world. The reliable estimate of incidence of the microscopy positive cases provided by the study should be very useful for assessing the efficacy of case finding in the District Tuberculosis Programme in India.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A novel urine lipoarabinomannan assay (FujiLAM) has higher sensitivity and higher cost than the first-generation AlereLAM assay. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of FujiLAM for tuberculosis testing among hospitalized people with HIV irrespective of symptoms. METHODS: We used a microsimulation model to project clinical and economic outcomes of three testing strategies: 1) sputum Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert); 2) sputum Xpert plus urine AlereLAM (Xpert+AlereLAM); 3) sputum Xpert plus urine FujiLAM (Xpert+FujiLAM). The modelled cohort matched that of a two-country clinical trial. We applied diagnostic yields from a retrospective study (yields for Xpert/Xpert+AlereLAM/Xpert+FujiLAM among those with CD4{$<$}200/µL: 33\%/62\%/70\%; among those with CD4≥200/µL: 33\%/35\%/47\%). Costs of Xpert/AlereLAM/FujiLAM were USD15/3/6 (South Africa) and USD25/3/6 (Malawi). Xpert+FujiLAM was considered cost-effective if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (USD/year-of-life saved) was {$<\$$}940 (South Africa) and {$<\$$}750 (Malawi). We varied key parameters in sensitivity analysis and performed a budget impact analysis of implementing FujiLAM countrywide. RESULTS: Compared with Xpert+AlereLAM, Xpert+FujiLAM increased life expectancy by 0.2 years for those tested in South Africa and Malawi. Xpert+FujiLAM was cost-effective in both countries. Xpert+FujiLAM for all patients remained cost-effective compared with sequential testing and CD4-stratified testing strategies. FujiLAM use added 3.5\% (South Africa) and 4.7\% (Malawi) to five-year healthcare costs of tested patients, primarily reflecting ongoing HIV treatment costs among survivors. CONCLUSIONS: FujiLAM with Xpert for tuberculosis testing in hospitalized people with HIV is likely to increase life expectancy and be cost-effective at the currently anticipated price in South Africa and Malawi. Additional studies should evaluate FujiLAM in clinical practice settings.},

  abstract = {One of the essential steps in targeting tuberculosis (TB) intervention is early diagnosis and treatment of patients by reducing the reservoir of infection in the community. In the North-Eastern (NE) region of India pulmonary TB and paragonimiasis are overlapping public health issues. We performed a cross-sectional study in 63 remote villages from the two states Arunachal Pradesh (AP) and Assam to determine the prevalence of undiagnosed TB and paragonimiasis cases using cough as a simple indicator. In AP, 2961 individuals aged five years and above were examined and 1108 (37.4\%) were found to have cough for one week or more. Of the 417 individuals who provided sputum, 11 (2.64\%) were smear positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). All these cases were yet undiagnosed, thus the prevalence of new smear positive TB in AP was 0.37\%. In Assam on the other hand 331 (23.5\%) subjects out of 1410 individuals who were examined had a cough for one week or more and of the 112 individuals who provided sputum, 13 (11.6\%) were smear positive for AFB. The prevalence of new smear positive TB cases was 0.78\% in Assam. Sero-positivity of paragonimiasis in coughers of AP was 7.6\% (n = 1091), which was significantly higher (p {$<$} 0.01) as compared to that in Assam (1.2\%, n = 321). The findings of the present study suggest that TB remains a major public health concern in the NE region of India especially in the remote places and there is need to strengthen early case detection of TB.},

  abstract = {Background Prevalence surveys have found a substantial burden of subclinical (asymptomatic but infectious) TB, from which individuals can progress, regress or even persist in a chronic disease state. We aimed to quantify these pathways across the spectrum of TB disease. Methods We created deterministic framework of TB disease with progression and regression between three states of pulmonary TB disease: minimal (non-infectious), subclinical, and clinical (symptomatic and infectious) disease. We estimated ranges for each parameter by considering all data from a systematic review in a Bayesian framework, enabling quantitative estimation of TB disease pathways. Findings Twenty-four studies contributed data from 6030 individuals. Results suggested that, after five years, 24.7\%(95\% uncertainty interval, UI, 21.3\%-28.6\%) of individuals with prevalent subclinical disease at baseline had either progressed to clinical disease or died from TB, whereas 16.1\%(95\%UI, 13.8\%-18.5\%) had recovered after regressing to minimal disease. Over the course of five years 30\% (95\%UI, 27.2\%-32.6\%) of the subclinial cohort never developed symptoms. For those with clinical disease at baseline, 39\%(95\%UI, 35.8\%-41.9\%) and 10.3\%(95\%UI, 8.5\%-12.4\%) had died or recovered from TB, with the remainder in, or undulating between, the three disease states. The ten-year mortality of people with untreated prevalent infectious disease was 38\%. Interpretation Our results show that for people with subclinical disease, classic clinical disease is neither inevitable nor an irreversible outcome. As such, reliance on symptom-based screening means a large proportion of people with infectious disease may never be detected. Funding TB Modelling and Analysis Consortium and European Research Council Evidence before this study In recent years the existence of a spectrum of TB disease has been re-accepted. The classic paradigm of disease is one active state of symptomatic presentation with bacteriologically positive sputum, now referred to as clinical disease. Within the spectrum, a subclinical phase (where people do not report symptoms but have bacteriologically positive sputum) has been widely accepted, due to prevalence surveys using chest radiography screening in addition to symptom screening. On average these prevalence surveys have found around 50\% of people with prevalent infectious TB had subclinical disease. There is also another state of minimal disease, or non-infectious disease, that is the earliest point on the disease spectrum after progression from infection. The likelihood or speed of natural progression, regression, or persistence of individuals across this spectrum remains unknown. As a consequence, the ability to accurately predict the impact of interventions has been limited. As individuals with bacteriologically-positive TB now receive treatment, contemporary data to inform the required transitions is highly limited. However, a large number of cohorts of patients were described in the pre-chemotherapy era. Until now, these data have not been synthesised to inform parameters to describe the natural history of TB disease.Added value of this study We synthesised data from historical and contemporary literature to explore the expected trajectories of individuals across the spectrum of TB disease. We considered a cohort of people with prevalent bacteriologically positive disease, with a 50/50 split of people with subclinical and clinical disease at baseline. We found that within five years, 13.3\% of people recover from TB, with no chance of progressing to active disease without reinfection. However, we also find that 26.3\% are still spending time infectious at the end of the five years. Our estimates for 10 year mortality and duration of symptoms before treatment aligned with the known and accepted values.We also show that regression from subclinical disease results in a large reservoir of people with minimal disease, from which they can permanently recover, but can also progress again to subclinical disease. The undulating pathways that lead to regression and progression mean that 30\% (27.2\%-32.6\%) of individuals with prevalent subclinical disease do not experience symptoms over the course of five years. This shows that clinical disease is neither a rapid, nor inevitable outcome of subclinical disease.Implications of the available evidence With these data-driven estimates of parameters, informed projections of the relative value of addressing minimal, subclinical, or clinical disease can now be provided. Given the known reservoir of prevalent subclinical disease and its contribution to transmission, efforts to diagnose and treat people with “earlier” stages of TB are likely to have a larger impact than strategies targeting clinical disease, particularly on individuals who never would have progressed to clinical disease.},

  abstract = {The average annual risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a calculated average from an observed prevalence of infection, approximating the incidence of infection. It has the potential to be informative about the extent of transmission in a community. Where serial surveys are available, secular trends in transmission might be ascertained. The prerequisite for calculating the average annual risk is the successful determination of the prevalence of infection. Difficulties arising with tuberculin skin-test surveys include logistical problems in sampling a representative portion of the population. Therefore, a compromise assesses the prevalence of infection among school children as an indicator of transmission in the community at large. The utilisation of tuberculin surveys is further compounded by the unpredictable specificity of the tuberculin skin test and, thus, the predictive value of a positive test result. Statistical approaches using mixture analysis may overcome this problem to some extent, but the experience is limited. Cytokine-derived assays, such as the interferon-gamma release assays, are promising in providing higher specificity, but they require venepuncture.},

  abstract = {The risk of acquiring infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis correlates with duration of exposure to an infectious source of tuberculosis. Contact identification is therefore a comparatively high-yield activity. However, in resource-poor settings tuberculin is rarely available, and even where it is available, non-specific cross-reactions to tuberculin resulting from BCG vaccination complicate the interpretation of tuberculin test results. The identification of a putative infection with M. tuberculosis in a contact must result in intervention. Excluding active tuberculosis is mandatory before preventive therapy is provided. This might prove difficult in areas where the most and often only affordable diagnostic means is microscopy. The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) has thus proposed to target preventive therapy to healthy children below the age of 5 years living in the same household as a sputum smear-positive tuberculosis case, with the sole recourse to clinical contact examination. While this approach will lead to treatment of a considerable proportion of uninfected children, the advantages are several-fold: first, these are the easiest identifiable contacts; second, they are particularly prone to progression to disease if infected; third, emerging drug resistance is of little concern at that age; fourth, administration of preventive treatment can be delegated to the source case. This approach is safe, simple, and affordable.},

Data sources for cascades vary and often are based on clinical cohorts, population cohorts linked to clinics, or self-reported information. We use both biomarkers and self-reported data from a large population-based cohort of older South Africans to establish the first HIV cascade for this growing segment of the HIV-positive population and compare results using the different data sources. METHODS: Data came from the Health and Aging in Africa: A Longitudinal Study of an INDEPTH Community in South Africa (HAALSI) 2015 baseline survey of 5059 adults aged 40+ years. Dried blood spots (DBS) were screened for HIV, antiretroviral drugs and viral load. In-home surveys asked about HIV testing, diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use. We calculated proportions and CIs for each stage of the cascade, conditional on attainment of the previous stage, using (1) biomarkers, (2) self-report and (3) both biomarkers and self-report, and compared with UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. RESULTS: 4560 participants had DBS results, among whom 1048 (23\%) screened HIV-positive and comprised the denominator for each cascade. The biomarker cascade showed 63\% (95\% CI 60 to 66) on ART and 72\% (95\% CI 69 to 76) of those on ART with viral suppression. Self-reports underestimated testing, diagnosis and ART, with only 47\% (95\% CI 44 to 50) of HIV-positive individuals reporting ART use. The combined cascade indicated high HIV testing (89\% (95\% CI 87 to 91)), but lower knowledge of HIV-positive status (71\% (95\% CI 68 to 74)). CONCLUSIONS: Older South Africans need repeated HIV testing and sustained ART to reach 90-90-90 targets. HIV cascades relying on self-reports are likely to underestimate true cascade attainment, and biomarkers provide substantial improvements to cascade estimates.},

  abstract = {SETTING: An aboriginal community of 653 persons. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and to analyse related factors. DESIGN: The total population was surveyed; those with chronic productive cough were asked to provide sputum specimens. PTB was diagnosed by bacilloscopy (acid-fast bacilli [AFB]). An analysis of socio-economic factors and clinical history associated with chronic cough or positive smear for PTB was carried out using multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Two hundred and two patients were identified with chronic cough and 173 with chronic productive cough. Chronic cough was associated with having a history of PTB (adjusted OR=4.89, 95\%CI 2.6-9.4) and with work-related migratory movements (adjusted OR=2.05, 95\%CI 1.3-3.3). Of 92 coughers with sputum samples analysed, 44 (47.8\%) were PTB-positive, giving a prevalence of 6.7\% in the whole population. In the groups aged 15-34 and {$>$}or=45 years, women had higher positivity rates than men, whereas in the group aged 35-44 years rates were higher in men. Twenty-seven per cent of families had one to four smear-positive members.

We aimed to estimate the effect of isoniazid preventive therapy given with antiretroviral therapy (ART) for the prevention of tuberculosis and death among people with HIV across population subgroups. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane database, and conference abstracts from database inception to Jan 15, 2019, to identify potentially eligible randomised trials. Eligible studies were trials that enrolled HIV-positive adults (age ≥15 years) taking ART who were randomly assigned to either daily isoniazid preventive therapy plus ART or ART alone and followed up longitudinally for outcomes of incident tuberculosis and mortality. We approached all authors of included trials and requested individual participant data: coprimary outcomes were relative risk of incident tuberculosis and all-cause mortality. We did a single-stage meta-analysis of individual participant data using stratified Cox-proportional hazards models. We did prespecified subgroup analyses by sex, CD4 cell count, and evidence of immune sensitisation to tuberculosis (indicated by tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assays [IGRAs]). We also assessed the relative risk of liver injury in an additional prespecified analysis. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019121400. FINDINGS: Of 838 records, we included three trials with data for 2611 participants and 8584·8 person-years of follow-up for the outcome of incident tuberculosis, and a subset of 2362 participants with 8631·6 person-years of follow-up for the coprimary outcome of all-cause mortality. Risk for tuberculosis was lower in participants given isoniazid preventive therapy and ART than participants given ART alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·68, 95\% CI 0·49-0·95, p=0·02). Risk of all-cause mortality was lower in participants given isoniazid preventive therapy and ART than participants given ART alone, but this difference was non-significant (HR 0·69, 95\% CI 0·43-1·10, p=0·12). Participants with baseline CD4 counts of less than 500 cells per μL had increased risk of tuberculosis, but there was no significant difference in the benefit of isoniazid preventive therapy with ART by sex, baseline CD4 count, or results of tuberculin skin test or IGRAs. 65 (2·5\%) of 2611 participants had raised alanine aminotransferase, but data were insufficient to calculate an HR. INTERPRETATION: Isoniazid preventive therapy with ART prevents tuberculosis across demographic and HIV-specific and tuberculosis-specific subgroups, which supports efforts to further increase use of isoniazid preventive therapy with ART broadly among people living with HIV.

A community-based survey was carried out between June-September 2005, whereby 61,730 adult household members were inquired about the presence of persistent cough for more than three weeks to identify TB suspects. These adults were then interviewed and referred to the nearest health center for clinical and sputum smear examination. Of the 61,730 surveyed household members, 1,544 (2.51\%) were identified as TB suspects, of these two were sputum smear positive pulmonary TB. The first action with the onset of symptoms was to visit the health centers. Reasons for timely seeking care were accessibility of the facilities and confidence in obtaining a cure, and obstacles were belief that symptoms would resolve and economic constraints in rural residents. Females, rural residents, expatriates, and using private means of transportation were predictors of delay in seeking care for more than three weeks. This study has set the baseline information about the prevalence of TB suspects in Jordan and their healthcare-seeking behavior that shows community preference to seek care at health centers. These should be upgraded and the health workers trained on suspect management to enhance the TB elimination efforts.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare socio-demographic, clinical and bacteriological characteristics and treatment outcomes of all patients detected at HF with those of all patients detected by CS during a 12-month period. RESULTS: Of 32,663 adults surveyed, 100 had smear-positive and 116 had smear-negative tuberculosis; of 65 smear-positive patients who began treatment, 44 were cured. Compared to HF patients, CS patients were significantly more likely to be older (AOR = 1.9), male (AOR = 2.7), non-literate (AOR = 1.7), and living in poor quality housing (AOR = 2.0), and were less likely to have cough {$>$}3 weeks (AOR = 3.4) or smear-positive tuberculosis (AOR = 4.2). Of 61 new smear-positive CS patients, 40 reported chest symptoms; of these, 32 (80\%) had already consulted a health-care provider, but remained undiagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: The community survey was of little value in tuberculosis case detection even in this high-prevalence setting. Patients identified by the survey were less symptomatic and less infectious, and less than half were cured.

RESULTS: We identified 14, four and one studies for C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). The pooled CRP sensitivity/specificity (95\% confidence interval) was 89\% (80-96) and 57\% (36-65). Sensitivity/specificity were higher in high-tuberculosis-burden countries (90\%/64\%), HIV-infected individuals (91\%/61\%) and community-based studies (90\%/62\%). IP-10 sensitivity/specificity in TB vs. non-TB studies was 85\%/63\% and in TB and HIV coinfected vs. other lung conditions 94\%/21\%. However, IP-10 studies included diverse populations and a high risk of bias, resulting in very low-quality evidence. AGP had 86\%/93\% sensitivity/specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have evaluated CRP, IP-10 and AGP for the triage of symptomatic patients. Their high sensitivity and moderate specificity warrant further prospective studies exploring whether their combined use could optimize performance.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To compare self-taken and healthcare worker (HCW)-taken throat/nasal swabs to perform rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for SARS-CoV-2, and how these compare to RT-PCR. We hypothesised that self-taken samples are non-inferior for use with RDTs and in clinical and research settings could have substantial individual and public health benefit. Design A prospective diagnostic accuracy evaluation as part of the Facilitating Accelerated Clinical Evaluation of Novel Diagnostic Tests for COVID -19 (FALCON C-19), workstream C (undifferentiated community testing). Setting NHS Test and Trace drive-through community PCR testing site (Liverpool, UK). Participants Eligible participants 18 years or older with symptoms of COVID-19. 250 participants recruited; one withdrew before analysis. Sampling Self-administered throat/nasal swab for the Covios RDT, a trained HCW taken throat/nasal sample for PCR and HCW comparison throat/nasal swab for RDT. Main outcome measures Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated; comparisons between self-taken and HCW-taken samples used McNemars test. Results Seventy-five participants (75/249, 30.1\%) were positive by RT-PCR. RDTs with self-taken swabs had a sensitivity of 90.5\% (67/74, 95\% CI: 83.9-97.2), compared to 78.4\% (58/74, 95\% CI: 69.0-87.8) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 12.2\%, 95\% CI: 4.7-19.6, p=0.003). Specificity for self-taken swabs was 99.4\% (173/174, 95\% CI: 98.3-100.0), versus 98.9\% (172/174, 95\% CI: 97.3-100.0) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 0.6\%, 95\% CI: 0.5-1.7, p=0.317). The PPV of self-taken RDTs (98.5\%, 67/68, 95\% CI: 95.7-100.0) and HCW-taken RDTs (96.7\%, 58/60, 95\% CI 92.1-100.0) were not significantly different (p=0.262). However, the NPV of self-taken swab RDTs was significantly higher (96.1\%, 173/180, 95\% CI: 93.2-98.9) than HCW-taken RDTs (91.5\%, 172/188, 95\% CI 87.5-95.5, p=0.003). Conclusion Self-taken swabs for COVID-19 testing offer substantial individual benefits in terms of convenience, accuracy, and reduced risk of transmitting infection. Our results demonstrate that self-taken throat/nasal samples can be used by lay individuals as part of rapid testing programmes for symptomatic adults.

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Injuries cause 30\% more deaths than HIV, TB and malaria combined, and a prospective fracture care registry was established to investigate the fracture burden and treatment in Malawi to inform evidence-based improvements. OBJECTIVE: To use the analysis of prospectively-collected fracture data to develop evidence-based strategies to improve fracture care in Malawi and other similar settings. DESIGN: Multicentre prospective registry study. SETTING: Two large referral centres and two district hospitals in Malawi. PARTICIPANTS: All patients with a fracture (confirmed by radiographs)-including patients with multiple fractures-were eligible to be included in the registry. EXPOSURE: All fractures that presented to two urban central and two rural district hospitals in Malawi over a 3.5-year period (September 2016 to March 2020). MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Demographics, characteristics of injuries, and treatment outcomes were collected on all eligible participants. RESULTS: Between September 2016 and March 2020, 23,734 patients were enrolled with a median age of 15 years (interquartile range: 10-35 years); 68.7\% were male. The most common injuries were radius/ulna fractures (n = 8,682, 36.8\%), tibia/fibula fractures (n = 4,036, 17.0\%), humerus fractures (n = 3,527, 14.9\%) and femoral fractures (n = 2,355, 9.9\%). The majority of fractures (n = 21,729, 91.6\%) were treated by orthopaedic clinical officers; 88\% (20,885/2,849) of fractures were treated non-operatively, and 62.7\% were treated and sent home on the same day. Open fractures (OR:53.19, CI:39.68-72.09), distal femoral fractures (OR:2.59, CI:1.78-3.78), patella (OR:10.31, CI:7.04-15.07), supracondylar humeral fractures (OR:3.10, CI:2.38-4.05), ankle fractures (OR:2.97, CI:2.26-3.92) and tibial plateau fractures (OR:2.08, CI:1.47-2.95) were more likely to be treated operatively compared to distal radius fractures. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The current model of fracture care in Malawi is such that trained orthopaedic surgeons manage fractures operatively in urban referral centres whereas orthopaedic clinical officers mainly manage fractures non-operatively in both district and referral centres. We recommend that orthopaedic surgeons should supervise orthopaedic clinical officers to manage non operative injuries in central and district hospitals. There is need for further studies to assess the clinical and patient reported outcomes of these fracture cases, managed both operatively and non-operatively.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sexual behaviour change contributed to reductions in HIV incidence in eastern and southern Africa between 1990 and 2010. More recently, there are indications that non-regular partnerships have increased. However, the effect of these increases on population-level risks for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections could have been reduced by simultaneous increases in condom use. We describe recent trends in sexual behaviour and condom use within the region and assess their combined effects on population levels of sexual risk. METHODS: Nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey data on sexually active males and females (15 to 49~years) were used for 11 eastern and southern African countries (≥3 surveys for each country; 1999 to 2016) to describe trends in sexual behaviour (multiple, non-regular, and casual sexual partnerships; condom use; age at first sex). Logistic regressions tested for statistical significance of changes. Analyses were stratified by sex. RESULTS: Recent increases in multiple, non-regular, and/or casual partnerships can be found for males in 10 countries and, for females, in nine countries; five countries exhibited recent decreases in age of sexual debut. Reduction in sex without condoms with non-regular partners was observed in six countries for males and eight for females. Changes in the proportion of the overall population reporting condomless sex with non-regular partners varied between countries, with declines in six countries and increases in three. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive change in sexual behaviour occurred across eastern and southern Africa during the period of scale-up of antiretroviral therapy programmes. This includes increasing multiple and non-regular partnerships, but their potential effects on population-level sexual risks were often offset by parallel increases in condom use. Strengthening condom programmes and reintegrating communication about behavioural dimensions into combination prevention programmes could help countries to meet international targets for reductions in HIV incidence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In high-burden settings, case fatality rates are reported to be between 11\% and 32\% in hospitalized patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis, yet the underlying causes of mortality remain poorly characterized. Understanding causes of mortality could inform the development of novel management strategies to improve survival. We aimed to assess clinical and microbiologic determinants of mortality and to characterize the pathophysiological processes underlying death by evaluating host soluble inflammatory mediators and determined the relationship between these mediators and death as well as biomarkers of disseminated tuberculosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult patients with HIV hospitalized with a new diagnosis of HIV-associated tuberculosis were enrolled in Cape Town between 2014 and 2016. Detailed tuberculosis diagnostic testing was performed. Biomarkers of tuberculosis dissemination and host soluble inflammatory mediators at baseline were assessed. Of 682 enrolled participants, 576 with tuberculosis (487/576, 84.5\% microbiologically confirmed) were included in analyses. The median age was 37 years (IQR = 31-43), 51.2\% were female, and the patients had advanced HIV with a median cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count of 58 cells/L (IQR = 21-120) and a median HIV viral load of 5.1 log10 copies/mL (IQR = 3.3-5.7). Antituberculosis therapy was initiated in 566/576 (98.3\%) and 487/576 (84.5\%) started therapy within 48 hours of enrolment. Twelve-week mortality was 124/576 (21.5\%), with 46/124 (37.1\%) deaths occurring within 7 days of enrolment. Clinical and microbiologic determinants of mortality included disseminated tuberculosis (positive urine lipoarabinomannan [LAM], urine Xpert MTB/RIF, or tuberculosis blood culture in 79.6\% of deaths versus 60.7\% of survivors, p = 0.001), sepsis syndrome (high lactate in 50.8\% of deaths versus 28.9\% of survivors, p {$<$} 0.001), and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (16.9\% of deaths versus 7.2\% of survivors, p = 0.002). Using non-supervised two-way hierarchical cluster and principal components analyses, we describe an immune profile dominated by mediators of the innate immune system and chemotactic signaling (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1Ra], IL-6, IL-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta [MIP-1β]/C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 [CCL4], interferon gamma-induced protein-10 [IP-10]/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 [CXCL10], MIP-1 alpha [MIP-1α]/CCL3), which segregated participants who died from those who survived. This immune profile was associated with mortality in a Cox proportional hazards model (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.2, 95\%CI = 1.9-2.7, p {$<$} 0.001) and with detection of biomarkers of disseminated tuberculosis. Clinicians attributing causes of death identified tuberculosis as a cause or one of the major causes of death in 89.5\% of cases. We did not perform longitudinal sampling and did not have autopsy-confirmed causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we did not identify a major contribution from coinfections to these deaths. Disseminated tuberculosis, sepsis syndrome, and rifampicin resistance were associated with mortality. An immune profile dominated by mediators of the innate immune system and chemotactic signaling was associated with both tuberculosis dissemination and mortality. These findings provide pathophysiologic insights into underlying causes of mortality and could be used to inform the development of novel treatment strategies and to develop methods to risk stratify patients to appropriately target novel interventions. Causal relationships cannot be established from this study.},

RISK11-positive participants were block randomised (1:2; block size 15) to once-weekly, directly-observed, open-label isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks (ie, RISK11 positive and 3HP positive), or no treatment (ie, RISK11 positive and 3HP negative). A subset of eligible RISK11-negative volunteers were randomly assigned to no treatment (ie, RISK11 negative and 3HP negative). Diagnostic discrimination of prevalent tuberculosis was tested in all participants at baseline. Thereafter, prognostic discrimination of incident tuberculosis was tested in the untreated RISK11-positive versus RISK11-negative groups, and treatment efficacy in the 3HP-treated versus untreated RISK11-positive groups, during active surveillance through 15 months. The primary endpoint was microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To obtain an estimate of the prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis in Eritrea using a new low-cost approach. METHODS: The study was designed to include a sample of 35,000 people divided between 40 clusters. The clusters were selected by sampling proportional to population size. In each cluster, census data were obtained from eligible individuals. Individuals aged 15 years or more were questioned about cough and its duration and smoking and were asked to provide two samples of sputum (spot and morning) for examination by fluorescence microscopy. FINDINGS: A total of 38,032 individuals were included in the study. Of the 19,197 individuals aged 15 years or more, 18,152 (94.6\%) provided at least one sample of sputum. Fifteen individuals fulfilled the case definition, providing a prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis of 90 per 100,000 (95\% confidence interval, CI, 35-145 per 100,000) individuals aged 15 years or more and 50 per 100,000 (95\% CI, 19-80 per 100,000) in the total population. CONCLUSION: The estimated prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis obtained from our study is considerably lower than the estimate published by the World Health Organization. The new methodology for surveys to determine the prevalence of tuberculosis that we used is feasible in the field. This methodology should be validated in other countries and compared with other methods for measuring prevalence.},

  abstract = {SETTING: Kisenyi slum in peri-urban Kampala, Uganda. OBJECTIVES: Using chronic cough ({$>$} weeks) inquiry as a screening tool to identify undetected smear-positive tuberculosis (TB) cases and to describe the characteristics of smear-positive TB cases detected by active case finding. DESIGN: A house-to-house survey was conducted in five randomly selected villages in Kampala between June and August 2005. A sample of households was visited; adults aged {$>$}15 years were consecutively interviewed to identify those with chronic cough. Three sputum specimens were collected and examined by smear microscopy. RESULTS: Among 930 individuals, we identified 189 (20\%) chronic coughers. Of these, we found 33 (18\%) undiagnosed smear-positive cases. The newly detected cases had an even sex distribution (P = 0.47), a median age of 30 years, a median cough duration of 1 month and 55\% had acid-fast bacilli 1+ sputum smear grade. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that active case finding could supplement DOTS to yield additional smear-positive TB cases, lead to early diagnosis and thus shorten the duration of infectiousness before effective chemotherapy is initiated. In communities such as Kisenyi, this is a feasible strategy that may prove useful for TB control, but its cost-effectiveness needs to be evaluated. Early health care seeking for cough should be emphasized. 2009 The Union.},

METHODS: In a door-to-door survey conducted in Rubaga community from January 2008 to June 2009, residents aged {$>$}15 years were screened for chronic cough ({$>$}2 weeks) and tested for TB disease using smear microscopy and/or culture. Rapid testing was used to screen for HIV infection. The NNS to detect one case was calculated based on population screened and undetected cases found. RESULTS: Of 5102 participants, 3868 (75.8\%) were females; the median age was 24 years (IQR 20-30). Of199 (4\%) with chronic cough, 160 (80.4\%) submitted sputum, of whom 39 (24.4\%, 95\%CI 17.4-31.5) had undetected active TB and 13 (8.1\%, 95\%CI 6.7-22.9) were TB-HIV co-infected. The NNS to detect one TB case was 131 in the whole study population, but only five among the subgroup with chronic cough. CONCLUSION: ACF obtained a high yield of previously undetected active TB and TB-HIV cases. The NNS in the general population was 131, but the number needed to test in persons with chronic cough was five. These findings suggest that boosting the identification of persons with chronic cough may increase the overall efficiency of TB case detection at a community level. 2014 The Union.},

  abstract = {RATIONALE: South Africa has a high prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV-coinfected adults in whom TB is often diagnosed late in the course of disease. OBJECTIVES: Improved case-finding approaches for TB and HIV are needed to reduce mortality and prevent transmission. METHODS: We identified newly diagnosed index TB cases in a rural district and enrolled their households in a TB-HIV contact-tracing study. A group of randomly selected control households were enrolled to determine community prevalence of undetected TB and HIV. Field teams screened participants for TB symptoms, collected sputum specimens for smear microscopy and culture, provided HIV counseling and testing, and collected blood for CD4 testing. Participants were referred to public clinics for TB treatment and antiretroviral therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We evaluated 2,843 household contacts of 727 index patients with TB and 983 randomly selected control household members. The prevalence of TB in household contacts was 6,075 per 100,000 (95\% confidence interval, 5,789-6,360 per 100,000), whereas the prevalence detected in randomly selected households was 407 per 100,000 (95\% confidence interval, 0-912 per 100,000; prevalence difference, 5,668 per 100,000; P {$<$} 0.001). TB detected among contacts was less likely to be smear-positive than in the index patients (6\% vs. 22\%; P {$<$} 0.001). Most contacts with culture-confirmed TB were asymptomatic. At least one case of undiagnosed TB was found in 141 (19\%) of 727 contact versus 4 (1\%) of 312 control households. HIV testing was positive in 166 (11\%) of 1,568 contacts tested versus 76 (14\%) of 521 control participants tested (odds ratio, 1.48; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Active case finding in TB contact households should be considered to improve TB and HIV case detection in high-prevalence settings, but sensitive diagnostic tools are necessary.},

DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, adults aged {$>$}14 years were surveyed by home-to-home visit, and asked about cough of {$>$} or = 2 weeks with or without sputum, chest pain or difficulty in breathing. Symptomatic suspects submitted three sputum samples for standard smear microscopy. RESULTS: Of 16697 adults surveyed, 436 (2.6\%) were symptomatic and submitted sputum samples. Thirteen (3\%) were positive for acid-fast bacilli, and the prevalence of smear-positive TB was 78 per 100 000 population (95\%CI 36-120). Twenty-four smear-positive cases identified through the existing health care delivery were on anti-tuberculosis medication at the time of the survey. The ratio of smear-positive cases on treatment to those newly detected by the survey was 2:1. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TB in this rural setting was unexpectedly low. For every two cases of smear-positive TB on treatment, there was one undetected infectious case in the community. However, as our screening technique did not allow detection of cases who did not report symptoms, the true prevalence may have been underestimated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the case notification rate of tuberculosis has been reported to be higher for men than women. In India also, the prevalence of TB is higher among males as compared to females but it is important to study the trend of gender gap in the prevalence of tuberculosis over the years. OBJECTIVE: To examine the trend in gender gap in the prevalence of TB over the years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The unit level data of NFHS-2 (1998-99) and NFHS-3 (2005-06) has been utilized. Gender gap in the prevalence of TB has been estimated for the two rounds of the surveys. The delta (Delta), the difference in gender gap in two surveys, has been estimated and decomposed by background characteristics such as place of residence(urban/rural), religion (Hindus/Muslims/others), caste(SC/ST/OBC/others) and standard of living(SLI) (low/medium/high) categories. MAIN FINDINGS: Overall, the prevalence of TB has remained almost same in the two surveys [432/lakh in NFHS-2 and 418/lakh in NFHJS-3; Z=1.19, P=0.275. The gender gap has increased to 217/lakh in NFHS-3 in comparison to 145 per lakh in NFHS-2. The increase in gender gap is significantly higher in rural areas [of 98 per lakh;167/ lakh in NFHS-2 vs 265/lakh in NFHS-3; P{$<$}0.05] as compared to corresponding increase in urban areas [of 30 per lakh; 88/ lakh in NFHS-2 vs118/ lakh in NFHS-3, P{$>$}0.05]. The increase in delta (D) (difference in gender gap in two surveys) is accounted for as 88\% by the rural areas and 12\% by the urban areas. CONCLUSION: The increase in gender gap in the prevalence of TB is more in rural areas as compared to urban areas. The increase in rural areas is mainly contributed by Hindus, SC and ST and low and medium SLI categories and in urban areas, the contribution is mainly by Hindus, other castes and high SLI categories.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In 2017, the Aurum Institute, with support from Unitaid, launched an initiative to expand short-course therapy for the prevention of tuberculosis (TB) in 12 high-burden countries. This study aimed to investigate the importance of "catalytic" effects beyond the original project timeframe when estimating cost-effectiveness of such large investments. METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of the IMPAACT4TB (I4TB) initiative from a health system perspective, using a 10-year time horizon. We first conservatively estimated costs using a "top-down" approach considering only the direct health benefits of providing TB preventive therapy to people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) through I4TB activities. We then re-estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of I4TB incorporating the costs and health benefits of potential catalytic effects beyond the program itself. RESULTS: We estimated that TB preventive therapy through the I4TB initiative alone would prevent 14~201 cases of active TB and 1562~TB deaths over 10~years with an up-front investment of \$52.5~million; the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness was \$1580 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. If this initiative could achieve its desired catalytic effects, an additional 375~648 cases and 41~321 deaths could be averted, at an incremental cost of \$546~million and cost-effectiveness of \$713 per DALY averted. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide donors with reasonable evidence of value for money to support investment in short-course TB preventive therapy for people initiating ART in high-burden settings. Our study also illustrates the importance of considering long-term secondary ("catalytic") effects when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of large-scale initiatives designed to change a global policy landscape.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Routine opt-out provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) remains underutilized in sub-Saharan Africa. By selectively targeting clients who either volunteer or have clinical indications of HIV disease, standard approaches to HIV counseling and testing are presumed more cost-efficient than PITC. METHODS: One thousand two hundred twenty-one patients aged 15– 49 years were seen by 22 practitioners in a mobile clinic in southern Zambia. A random sample of physicians was assigned to administer PITC, whereas the remaining practitioners offered standard non- PITC (ie, voluntary or diagnostic). Questionnaires assessed patient demographics and attitudes toward HIV. HIV detection rates were stratified by referral type, demographics, and HIV-related knowledge and attitudes. RESULTS: HIV prevalence was 10.6\%. Infection rates detected using PITC [11.1\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 8.8\% to 13.5\%] and standard non-PITC (10.0\%; 95\% CI: 7.5\% to 12.5\%) did not significantly differ (odds ratio = 1.01; 95\% CI: 0.67 to 1.52; P = 0.95). Patients who did not request testing or demonstrate clinical indicators of HIV did not have significantly higher HIV prevalence than those who did (odds ratio = 0.83; 95\% CI: 0.55 to 1.24; P = 0.36). Implementation of PITC was highly acceptable and produced a 3-fold increase in patients tested per practitioner compared with standard non-PITC (114 vs. 34 patients per practitioner, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: PITC detected a comparable HIV infection rate as a standard non-PITC approach among rural adults seeking primary care services. Widespread implementation of PITC may therefore lead to significantly more cases of HIV detected.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impressive achievements have been made towards achieving universal coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the effects of rapid ART scale-up on delays between HIV diagnosis and treatment initiation have not been well described. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study covering eight years of ART initiators (2004-2011) was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi. The time between most recent positive HIV test and ART initiation was calculated and temporal trends in delay to initiation were described. Factors associated with time to initiation were investigated using multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: From 2004-2011, there were 15,949 ART initiations at QECH (56\% female; 8\% children [0-10 years] and 5\% adolescents [10-20 years]). Male initiators were likely to have more advanced HIV infection at initiation than female initiators (70\% vs. 64\% in WHO stage 3 or 4). Over the eight years studied, there were declines in treatment delay, with 2011 having the shortest delay at 36.5 days. On multivariate analysis CD4 count {$<$}50 cells/μl (adjusted geometric mean ratio [aGMR]: aGMR: 0.53, bias-corrected accelerated [BCA] 95\% CI: 0.42-0.68) was associated with shorter ART treatment delay. Women (aGMR: 1.12, BCA 95\% CI: 1.03-1.22) and patients diagnosed with HIV at another facility outside QECH (aGMR: 1.61, BCA 95\% CI: 1.47-1.77) had significantly longer treatment delay. CONCLUSIONS: Continued improvements in treatment delays provide evidence that universal access to ART can be achieved using the public health approach adopted by Malawi However, the longer delays for women and patients diagnosed at outlying sites emphasises the need for targeted interventions to support equitable access for these groups.},

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to estimate the effect of 6 and 12 month courses of INH for preventing TB in HIV-negative people at increased risk of developing active TB. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Medline, Embase and reference lists of articles. We hand-searched Science Citation Index and Index Medicus. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of INH preventive therapy for 6 months or more compared with placebo. Follow-up for a minimum of 2 years. Trials enrolling patients with current or previously treated active TB, or with known HIV infection, were excluded. Criteria were applied by two reviewers independently. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Trial quality was assessed by two reviewers independently, and data extracted by one reviewer using a standardized extraction form. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials involving 73,375 patients were included. Trials were generally of high quality. Treatment with INH resulted in a relative risk (RR) of developing active TB of 0.40, (95\% confidence interval ¿CI¿ 0.31 to 0.52), over two years or longer. There was no significant difference between 6 and 12 month courses (RR of 0.44, 95\% CI 0.27 to 0.73 for six months, and 0.38, 95\% CI 0.28 to 0.50 for 12 months). Preventive therapy reduced deaths from TB, but this effect was not seen for all cause mortality. INH was associated with hepatotoxicity in 0.36\% of people on 6 months treatment and in 0.52\% of people treated for 12 months. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Isoniazid is effective for the prevention of active TB in diverse at-risk patients, and six and 12 month regimens have a similar effect.},

Indonesia is estimated to have the third highest case load worldwide, but TB prevalence has not been measured for 25 years. METHODS: In 2004, 20000 households were selected in all 30 provinces. All adults (aged {$>$}/=15 years) in every household were screened for symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Among those with symptoms, TB was diagnosed by sputum smear microscopy and sputum culture. RESULTS: Eighty adults were positive on at least two sputum smears (104 per 100000 population, 95\%CI 66-142). Prevalence was lower in Central Indonesia (Java-Bali, 59/100000) than in the Western (Sumatra, 160/100000) or Eastern regions (189/100000), but the estimated 225000 prevalent cases were distributed evenly among the three regions. The national per capita prevalence in 2004 was lower than in 1979-1982 by a factor of three (3.1, 95\%CI 1.2-4.9), and the total number of cases was lower by a factor of two. CONCLUSIONS: Although the 2004 national survey may have underestimated the prevalence of smear-positive TB in Indonesia, there is strong evidence that it fell markedly between 1979-1982 and 2004.},

Data on the costs of ACF are limited, with little consistency in the units and methods used to estimate and report costs. Mathematical models to forecast the long-term effects of ACF require empirical measurements of the yield, timing and costs of case detection. Pragmatic trials offer an opportunity to assess the cost-effectiveness of ACF interventions within a ‘real-world´ context. However, such analyses generally require early introduction of economic evaluations to enable prospective data collection on resource requirements. Closing the global case-detection gap will require substantial additional resources, including continued investment in innovative technologies. Research is essential to the optimal implementation, cost-effectiveness, and affordability of ACF in high-burden settings. To assess the value of ACF, we must prioritize the collection of high-quality data regarding costs and effectiveness, and link those data to analytical models that are adapted to local settings.},

  abstract = {Most of the world's tuberculosis cases occur in low-income and middle-income countries, where sputum microscopy with a conventional light microscope is the primary method for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis. A major shortcoming of conventional microscopy is its relatively low sensitivity compared with culture, especially in patients co-infected with HIV. In high-income countries, fluorescence microscopy rather than conventional microscopy is the standard diagnostic method. Fluorescence microscopy is credited with increased sensitivity and lower work effort, but there is concern that specificity may be lower. We did a systematic review to summarise the accuracy of fluorescence microscopy compared with conventional microscopy. By searching many databases and contacting experts, we identified 45 relevant studies. Sensitivity, specificity, and incremental yield were the outcomes of interest. The results suggest that, overall, fluorescence microscopy is more sensitive than conventional microscopy, and has similar specificity. There is insufficient evidence to determine the value of fluorescence microscopy in HIV-infected individuals. The results of this review provide a point of reference, quantifying the potential benefit of fluorescence microscopy, with which the increased cost and technical complexity of the method can be compared to determine the possible value of the method under programme conditions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a WHO-recommended HIV prevention method for people at high risk for acquiring HIV, is being increasingly implemented in many countries. Setting programmatic targets, particularly in generalised epidemics, could incorporate estimates of the size of the population likely to be eligible for PrEP using incidence-based thresholds. We estimated the proportion of men and women who would be eligible for PrEP and the number of HIV infections that could be averted in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia using prioritisation based on age, sex, geography, and markers of risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analysed the latest nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia to determine the proportion of adults who report behavioural markers of risk for HIV infection. We used prevalence ratios (PRs) to quantify the association of these factors with HIV status. Using a multiplier method, we combined these proportions with the number of new HIV infections by district, derived from district-level modelled HIV estimates. Based on these numbers, different scenarios were analysed for the minimum number of person-years on PrEP needed to prevent 1 HIV infection (NNP). An estimated total of 38,000, 108,000, and 46,000 new infections occurred in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia in 2016, corresponding with incidence rates of 0.43, 0.63, and 0.57 per 100 person-years. In these countries, 9\%-20\% of new infections occurred among people with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past 12 months and 40\%-42\% among people with either an STI or a non-regular sexual partner (NP) in the past 12 months (STINP). The models estimate that around 50\% of new infections occurred in districts with incidence rates ≥1.0\% in Mozambique and Zambia and ≥0.5\% in Malawi. In Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia, 35.1\%, 21.9\%, and 12.5\% of the population live in these high-incidence districts. In the most parsimonious scenario, if women aged 15-34 years and men 20-34 years with an STI in the past 12 months living in high-incidence districts were to take PrEP, it would take a minimum of 65.8 person-years on PrEP to avert 1 HIV infection per year in Malawi, 35.2 in Mozambique, and 16.4 in Zambia. Our findings suggest that 3,300, 5,200, and 1,700 new infections could be averted per year in the 3 countries, respectively. Limitations of our study are that these values are based on modelled estimates of HIV incidence and self-reported behavioural risk factors from national surveys. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of new HIV infections in these 3 African countries were estimated to occur among people who had either an STI or an NP in the past year, providing a straightforward means to set PrEP targets. Greater prioritisation of PrEP by district, sex, age, and behavioural risk factors resulted in lower NNPs thereby increasing PrEP cost-effectiveness, but also diminished the overall impact on reducing new infections.},

  abstract = {High resolution, contemporary data on human population distributions are vital for measuring impacts of population growth, monitoring human-environment interactions and for planning and policy development. Many methods are used to disaggregate census data and predict population densities for finer scale, gridded population data sets. We present a new semi-automated dasymetric modeling approach that incorporates detailed census and ancillary data in a flexible, “Random Forest” estimation technique. We outline the combination of widely available, remotely-sensed and geospatial data that contribute to the modeled dasymetric weights and then use the Random Forest model to generate a gridded prediction of population density at \textasciitilde 100 m spatial resolution. This prediction layer is then used as the weighting surface to perform dasymetric redistribution of the census counts at a country level. As a case study we compare the new algorithm and its products for three countries (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Kenya) with other common gridded population data production methodologies. We discuss the advantages of the new method and increases over the accuracy and flexibility of those previous approaches. Finally, we outline how this algorithm will be extended to provide freely-available gridded population data sets for Africa, Asia and Latin America.},

Changes in environment and land use result in the spread of vector-borne diseases into new areas, and global travel and trade may introduce pathogens to non-immune populations. The breakdown of health services following political change or during conflict can result in the resurgence of previously controlled communicable diseases. The importance of collaboration between human and veterinary health services is emphasized, and the UK ‘DATER’ strategy (Detection, Assessment, Treatment, Escalation, Recovery) for dealing with pandemic influenza is applied to new and emerging infections.

Video-observed therapy (VOT) has been conditionally recommended by WHO as an alternative to DOT. We tested whether levels of treatment observation were improved with VOT.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We did a multicentre, analyst-blinded, randomised controlled superiority trial in 22 clinics in England (UK). Eligible participants were patients aged at least 16 years with active pulmonary or non-pulmonary tuberculosis who were eligible for DOT according to local guidance. Exclusion criteria included patients who did not have access to charging a smartphone. We randomly assigned participants to either VOT (daily remote observation using a smartphone app) or DOT (observations done three to five times per week in the home, community, or clinic settings). Randomisation was done by the SealedEnvelope service using minimisation. DOT involved treatment observation by a health-care or lay worker, with any remaining daily doses self-administered. VOT was provided by a centralised service in London. Patients were trained to record and send videos of every dose ingested 7 days per week using a smartphone app. Trained treatment observers viewed these videos through a password-protected website. Patients were also encouraged to report adverse drug events on the videos. Smartphones and data plans were provided free of charge by study investigators. DOT or VOT observation records were completed by observers until treatment or study end. The primary outcome was completion of 80\% or more scheduled treatment observations over the first 2 months following enrolment. Intention-to-treat (ITT) and restricted (including only patients completing at least 1 week of observation on allocated arm) analyses were done. Superiority was determined by a 15\% difference in the proportion of patients with the primary outcome (60\% \emph{vs} 75\%). This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number registry, number ISRCTN26184967.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Between Sept 1, 2014, and Oct 1, 2016, we randomly assigned 226 patients; 112 to VOT and 114 to DOT. Overall, 131 (58\%) patients had a history of homelessness, imprisonment, drug use, alcohol problems or mental health problems. In the ITT analysis, 78 (70\%) of 112 patients on VOT achieved ≥80\% scheduled observations successfully completed during the first 2 months compared with 35 (31\%) of 114 on DOT (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 5·48, 95\% CI 3·10–9·68; p{$<$}0·0001). In the restricted analysis, 78 (77\%) of 101 patients on VOT achieved the primary outcome compared with 35 (63\%) of 56 on DOT (adjusted OR 2·52; 95\% CI 1·17–5·54; p=0·017).

OBJECTIVE: We estimated test sensitivity/specificity and latent TB infection prevalence in a prospective, US-based cohort of 10\,740 participants at high risk for latent infection. METHODS: Bayesian latent class analysis was used to estimate test sensitivity/specificity and latent TB infection prevalence among subgroups based on age, foreign birth outside the USA and HIV infection. RESULTS: Latent TB infection prevalence varied from 4.0\% among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged {$<$}5 years to 34.0\% among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥5 years. Test sensitivity ranged from 45.8\% for the T-SPOT.TB among foreign-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged ≥5 years to 80.7\% for the tuberculin skin test among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥5 years. The skin test was less specific than either interferon-γ release assay, particularly among foreign-born populations (eg, the skin test had 70.0\% specificity among foreign-born, HIV-seronegative persons aged ≥5 years vs 98.5\% and 99.3\% specificity for the QuantiFERON and T-SPOT.TB, respectively). The tuberculin skin test's positive predictive value ranged from 10.0\% among foreign-born children aged {$<$}5 years to 69.2\% among foreign-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged ≥5 years; the positive predictive values of the QuantiFERON (41.4\%) and T-SPOT.TB (77.5\%) were also low among US-born, HIV-seropositive persons aged ≥5 years. CONCLUSIONS: These data reinforce guidelines preferring interferon-γ release assays for foreign-born populations and recommending against screening populations at low risk for latent TB infection.

In this article, we describe methods for estimating gaps (patient losses) and steps (patients retained) in the care cascade for active TB disease. We highlight approaches for overcoming challenges in constructing the TB care cascade, which include difficulties in estimating the population-level burden of disease and the diagnostic gap due to the limited sensitivity of TB diagnostic tests.

Digital adherence technologies (DATs)-which include feature phone-based and smartphone-based technologies, digital pillboxes and ingestible sensors-may facilitate more patient-centric approaches for monitoring adherence, though available data are limited. Depending on the specific technology, DATs may help to remind patients to take their medications, facilitate digital observation of pill-taking, compile dosing histories and triage patients based on their level of adherence, which can facilitate provision of individualised care by TB programmes to patients with varied levels of risk. Research is needed to understand whether DATs are acceptable to patients and healthcare providers, accurate for measuring adherence, effective in improving treatment outcomes and impactful in improving health system efficiency.

We used active community surveillance to compare the impact of DOTS with earlier programmes. METHODS: We conducted tuberculosis disease surveys using random cluster sampling of a rural population in South India approximately every 2.5 years from 1968 to 1986, using radiography as a screening tool for sputum examination. In 1999, DOTS was implemented in the area. Prevalence surveys using radiography and symptom screening were conducted at the start of DOTS implementation and after 2.5 years. RESULTS: From 1968 to 1999, culture-positive and smear-positive tuberculosis declined by 2.3 and 2.5\% per annum compared with 11.9 and 5.6\% after DOTS implementation. The 2.5 year period of DOTS implementation accounted for one-fourth of the decline in prevalence of culture-positive tuberculosis over 33 years. Multivariate analysis showed that prevalence of culture-positive tuberculosis decreased substantially (10.0\% per annum, 95\% CI: 2.8-16.6\%) owing to DOTS after only slight declines related to temporal trends (2.1\% annual decline, 95\% CI: 1.1-3.2\%) and short-course chemotherapy (1.5\% annual decline, 95\% CI: -9.7\% to 11.5\%). Under DOTS, the proportion of total cases identified through clinical care increased from 81 to 92\%. CONCLUSIONS: Following DOTS implementation, prevalence of culture-positive tuberculosis decreased rapidly following a gradual decline for the previous 30 years. In the absence of a large HIV epidemic and with relatively low levels of rifampicin resistance, DOTS was associated with rapid reduction of tuberculosis prevalence.},

DESIGN: Surveys of PTB were undertaken on representative population samples aged {$>$}15 years (n = 83 000-90000), before and at 2.5 and 5 years after the implementation of the DOTS strategy. The prevalence of PTB (smear-positive/culture-positive) was estimated.

The annual rate of decline was 12.6\% (95\%CI 11.2-14.0) for culture-positive TB and 12.3\% (95\%CI 8.6-15.8) for smear-positive TB. The decline was similar at all ages and for both sexes. CONCLUSION: With an efficient case detection programme and the DOTS strategy, it is feasible to bring about a substantial reduction in the burden of TB in the community. 2008 The Union.},

Using a TB transmission model calibrated for South Africa, we estimated the epidemiologic impact and resource requirements (financial, human resource (HR), and diagnostic) of 9 case-finding interventions. We compared the model-estimated resources with scenarios of future resource availability and estimated the impact of interventions under these constraints. Without constraints, symptom screening in public health clinics and among persons receiving care for human immunodeficiency virus infection was predicted to lead to larger reductions in TB incidence (9.5\% (2.5th-97.5th percentile range (PR), 8.6-12.2) and 14.5\% (2.5th-97.5th PR, 12.2-16.3), respectively) than improved adherence to diagnostic guidelines (2.7\%; 2.5th-97.5th PR, 1.6-4.1). However, symptom screening required large increases in resources, exceeding future HR capacity. Even under our most optimistic HR scenario, the reduction in TB incidence from clinic symptom screening was 0.2\%-0.9\%-less than that of improved adherence to diagnostic guidelines. Ignoring resource constraints may result in incorrect conclusions about an intervention's impact and may lead to suboptimal policy decisions. Models used for decision-making should consider resource constraints.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), individuals may rapidly develop tuberculosis (TB) disease or enter a "latent" infection state with a low risk of progression to disease. Mathematical models use a variety of structures and parameterisations to represent this process. The effect of these different assumptions on the predicted impact of TB interventions has not been assessed. METHODS: We explored how the assumptions made about progression from infection to disease affect the predicted impact of TB preventive therapy. We compared the predictions using three commonly used model structures, and parameters derived from two different data sources. RESULTS: The predicted impact of preventive therapy depended on both the model structure and parameterisation. At a baseline annual TB incidence of 500/100,000, there was a greater than 2.5-fold difference in the predicted reduction in incidence due to preventive therapy (ranging from 6 to 16\%), and the number needed to treat to avert one TB case varied between 67 and 157. The relative importance of structure and parameters depended on baseline TB incidence and assumptions about the efficacy of preventive therapy, with the choice of structure becoming more important at higher incidence. CONCLUSIONS: The assumptions use to represent progression to disease in models are likely to influence the predicted impact of preventive therapy and other TB interventions. Modelling estimates of TB preventive therapy should consider routinely incorporating structural uncertainty, particularly in higher burden settings. Not doing so may lead to inaccurate and over confident conclusions, and sub-optimal evidence for decision making.},

This study tried to detect the spatial distribution and clustering of smear-positive tuberculosis cases in Dabat, Ethiopia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A population-based cross sectional study conducted in the Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site from October 2010 to September 2011 identified smear-positive tuberculosis cases. Trained field workers collected demographic and location data from each study participant through house-to-house visits. A spatial scan statistic was used to identify purely spatial and space-time clusters of tuberculosis among permanent residents. Two significant (p{$<$}0.001) spatial and space-time clusters were identified in the study district. CONCLUSION: Tuberculosis is concentrated in certain geographic locations in Dabat, Ethiopia. This kind of clustering can be common in the country, so the National Tuberculosis Control Program can be more effective by identifying such clusters and targeting interventions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) case detection rate remains low in Ethiopia. One of the underlying reasons is the emphasis on passive case finding strategy which may seriously underestimate the burden of the disease. Estimating the prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary TB through active case finding at population level can help assessing the degree to which passive case detection is successful. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is population based cross-sectional study. The study population was all individuals aged {$>$}/=14 years. Interviews using a uniform questionnaire were done initially to identify individuals with chronic cough ({$>$}/=15 days) and the two sputum (spot and morning) samples were gathered for standard smear microscopy. A total of 23,590 individuals aged {$>$}/=14 years were interviewed and 984 had a chronic cough for {$>$}/=15 days. Of 831 individuals who provided two sputum samples for acid fast bacilli (AFB), 41 had positive smears. A total of 22 smear-positive TB cases detected through passive case finding were on anti-TB treatment. The prevalence of new smear-positive TB was 174 per 100,000 in persons aged {$>$}/=14 years (95\% CI: 121-227).The ratio of active to passive case finding was 2:1. Higher rates of smear-positivity were observed among females [AOR: 3.28, 95\% CI (1.54-6.77)], and in the age group {$>$}/=45 years [AOR: 2.26, 95\% CI (1.12-4.59). CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that about two-thirds of patients with active TB remain undiagnosed and thus untreated. This may indicate the need for strengthening case detection at the community level. Furthermore, the high burden of TB among females and in the age group {$>$}/=45 years warrants appropriate measures to control the disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of HIV-infected individuals in the UK are unaware of their status and late presentations continue, especially in low prevalence areas. Fourth generation antigen/antibody rapid test kits could facilitate earlier diagnosis of HIV in non-clinical settings but lack data on performance under programmatic conditions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated the performance of Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo Test (Determine Combo), a rapid test with indicators for both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen, in participants recruited from community outreach and hospital-based sexual health clinics. HIV infection was confirmed using laboratory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA), Line Immuno Assay (LIA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In total, 953 people underwent HIV testing. HIV antibody (Ab) prevalence was 1.8\% (17/953). Four false positive rapid tests were identified: two antibody and two p24 antigen (Ag) reactions. Of participants diagnosed as HIV Ab positive, 2/17 (12\%) were recent seroconverters based on clinical history and HIV antibody avidity test results. However, none of these were detected by the p24 antigen component of the rapid test kit. There were no other true positive p24 Ag tests. CONCLUSION: These data lend support to an increasing body of evidence suggesting that 4th generation rapid HIV tests have little additional benefit over 3rd generation HIV kits for routine screening in low prevalence settings and have high rates of false positives. In order to optimally combine community-based case-finding among hard-to-reach groups with reliable and early diagnosis 3rd generation kits should be primarily used with laboratory testing of individuals thought to be at risk of acute HIV infection. A more reliable point of care diagnostic is required for the accurate detection of acute HIV infection under programmatic conditions.},

The mean total costs ranged from \$55 to \$8198, with an unweighted average of \$847. On average, 20\% (range 0–62\%) of the total cost was due to direct medical costs, 20\% (0–84\%) to direct non-medical costs, and 60\% (16–94\%) to income loss. Half of the total cost was incurred before TB treatment. On average, the total cost was equivalent to 58\% (range 5–306\%) of reported annual individual and 39\% (4–148\%) of reported household income. Cost as percentage of income was particularly high among poor people and those with multidrug-resistant TB. Commonly reported coping mechanisms included taking a loan and selling household items. The total cost of TB for patients can be catastrophic. Income loss often constitutes the largest financial risk for patients. Apart from ensuring that healthcare services are fairly financed and delivered in a way that minimises direct and indirect costs, there is a need to ensure that TB patients and affected families receive appropriate income replacement and other social protection interventions.

  abstract = {The landmark HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 052 trial in HIV-discordant couples demonstrated unequivocally that treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) substantially lowers the probability of HIV transmission to the HIV-uninfected partner. However, it has been vigorously debated whether substantial population-level reductions in the rate of new HIV infections could be achieved in "real-world" sub-Saharan African settings where stable, cohabiting couples are often not the norm and where considerable operational challenges exist to the successful and sustainable delivery of treatment and care to large numbers of patients. We used data from one of Africa's largest population-based prospective cohort studies (in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) to follow up a total of 16,667 individuals who were HIV-uninfected at baseline, observing individual HIV seroconversions over the period 2004 to 2011. Holding other key HIV risk factors constant, individual HIV acquisition risk declined significantly with increasing ART coverage in the surrounding local community. For example, an HIV-uninfected individual living in a community with high ART coverage (30 to 40\% of all HIV-infected individuals on ART) was 38\% less likely to acquire HIV than someone living in a community where ART coverage was low ({$<$}10\% of all HIV-infected individuals on ART). The risk of acquiring HIV is reduced in rural communities via large-scale delivery of antiretroviral therapy.

As studies were heterogeneous, data synthesis was narrative. Findings Clinical review: of 27,270 articles, 18 (n=3 trials) were eligible. Nine involved general populations. Compared to passive case finding (PCF), studies showed lower smear grade (n=2/3) and time to diagnosis (n=2/3); higher pre-treatment losses to follow-up (screened 23\% and 29\% vs PCF 15\% and 14\%; n=2/2); and similar treatment success (range 68-81\%; n=4) and case fatality (range 3-11\%; n=5) in the screened group. Nine reported on risk groups. Compared to PCF, studies showed lower smear positivity among those culture-confirmed (n=3/4) and time to diagnosis (n=2/2); and similar (range 80-90\%; n=2/2) treatment success in the screened group. Case fatality was lower in n=2/3 observational studies; both reported on established screening programmes. A neonatal trial and post-hoc analysis of a household contacts trial found screening was associated with lower all-cause mortality. Economic review: From 2841 articles, six observational studies were eligible. Total costs (n=6) and catastrophic cost prevalence (n=4; range screened 9-45\% vs PCF 12-61\%) was lower among those screened. Interpretation We found very limited patient outcome data.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, the burden of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated tuberculosis is high. We conducted a trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design to assess the benefits of early antiretroviral therapy (ART), 6-month isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), or both among HIV-infected adults with high CD4+ cell counts in Ivory Coast. METHODS: We included participants who had HIV type 1 infection and a CD4+ count of less than 800 cells per cubic millimeter and who met no criteria for starting ART according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: deferred ART (ART initiation according to WHO criteria), deferred ART plus IPT, early ART (immediate ART initiation), or early ART plus IPT. The primary end point was a composite of diseases included in the case definition of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), non-AIDS-defining cancer, non-AIDS-defining invasive bacterial disease, or death from any cause at 30 months. We used Cox proportional models to compare outcomes between the deferred-ART and early-ART strategies and between the IPT and no-IPT strategies. RESULTS: A total of 2056 patients (41\% with a baseline CD4+ count of ≥500 cells per cubic millimeter) were followed for 4757 patient-years. A total of 204 primary end-point events were observed (3.8 events per 100 person-years; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 to 4.4), including 68 in patients with a baseline CD4+ count of at least 500 cells per cubic millimeter (3.2 events per 100 person-years; 95\% CI, 2.4 to 4.0). Tuberculosis and invasive bacterial diseases accounted for 42\% and 27\% of primary end-point events, respectively. The risk of death or severe HIV-related illness was lower with early ART than with deferred ART (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.41 to 0.76; adjusted hazard ratio among patients with a baseline CD4+ count of ≥500 cells per cubic millimeter, 0.56; 95\% CI, 0.33 to 0.94) and lower with IPT than with no IPT (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.48 to 0.88; adjusted hazard ratio among patients with a baseline CD4+ count of ≥500 cells per cubic millimeter, 0.61; 95\% CI, 0.36 to 1.01). The 30-month probability of grade 3 or 4 adverse events did not differ significantly among the strategies. CONCLUSIONS: In this African country, immediate ART and 6 months of IPT independently led to lower rates of severe illness than did deferred ART and no IPT, both overall and among patients with CD4+ counts of at least 500 cells per cubic millimeter.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: CNS infections are a leading cause of HIV-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, but causes and outcomes are poorly defined. We aimed to determine mortality and predictors of mortality in adults evaluated for meningitis in Botswana, which has an estimated 23\% HIV prevalence among adults. METHODS: In this prevalent cohort study, patient records from 2004-15 were sampled from the Botswana national meningitis survey, a nationwide audit of all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) laboratory records from patients receiving a lumbar puncture for evaluation of meningitis. Data from all patients with culture-confirmed pneumococcal and tuberculous meningitis, and all patients with culture-negative meningitis with CSF white cell count (WCC) above 20 cells per μL were included in our analyses, in addition to a random selection of patients with culture-negative CSF and CSF WCC of up to 20 cells per μL. We used patient national identification numbers to link CSF laboratory records from the national meningitis survey to patient vital registry and HIV databases. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate clinical and laboratory predictors of mortality. FINDINGS: We included data from 238 patients with culture-confirmed pneumococcal meningitis, 48 with culture-confirmed tuberculous meningitis, and 2900 with culture-negative CSF (including 1691 with CSF WCC of up to 20 cells per μL and 1209 with CSF WCC above 20 cells per μL). Median age was 37 years (IQR 31-46), 1605 (50\%) of 3184 patients were male, 2188 (72\%) of 3023 patients with registry linkage had documentation of HIV infection, and median CD4 count was 139 cells per μL (IQR 63-271). 10-week and 1-year mortality was 47\% (112 of 238) and 49\% (117 of 238) for pneumococcal meningitis, 46\% (22 of 48) and 56\% (27 of 48) for tuberculous meningitis, and 41\% (1181 of 2900) and 49\% (1408 of 2900) for culture-negative patients. When the analysis of patients with culture-negative CSF was restricted to those with known HIV infection, WCC (0-20 cells per μL vs {$>$}20 cells per μL) was not predictive of mortality (average hazard ratio 0·93, 95\% CI 0·80-1·09). INTERPRETATION: Mortality from pneumococcal, tuberculous, and culture-negative meningitis was high in this setting of high HIV prevalence. There is an urgent need for improved access to diagnostics, to better define aetiologies and develop novel diagnostic tools and treatment algorithms.

  abstract = {Globally, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is the most widely used PCR test for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). Positive results in previously treated patients, which are due to old DNA or active disease, are a diagnostic dilemma. We prospectively retested sputum from 238 patients, irrespective of current symptoms, who were previously diagnosed to be Xpert positive and treated successfully. Patients who retested as Xpert positive and culture negative were exhaustively investigated (repeat culture, chest radiography, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, long-term clinical follow-up). We evaluated whether the duration since previous treatment completion, mycobacterial burden (the Xpert cycle threshold [CT] value), and reclassification of Xpert-positive results with a very low semiquantitation level to Xpert-negative results reduced the rate of false positivity. A total of 229/238 (96\%) of patients were culture negative. Sixteen of 229 (7\%) were Xpert positive a median of 11 months (interquartile range, 5 to 19 months) after treatment completion. The specificity was 93\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 89 to 96\%). Nine of 15 (40\%) Xpert-positive, culture-negative patients reverted to Xpert negative after 2 to 3 months (1 patient declined further participation). Patients with false-positive Xpert results had a lower mycobacterial burden than patients with true-positive Xpert results (CT, 28.7 [95\% CI, 27.2 to 30.4] versus 17.6 [95\% CI, 16.9 to 18.2]; P {$<$} 0.001), an increased likelihood of a chest radiograph not compatible with active TB (5/15 patients versus 0/5 patients; P = 0.026), and less-viscous sputum (15/16 patients versus 2/5 patients whose sputum was graded as mucoid or less; P = 0.038). All patients who initially retested as Xpert positive and culture negative (“Xpert false positive”) were clinically well without treatment after follow-up. The duration since the previous treatment poorly predicted false-positive results (a duration of ≤2 years identified only 66\% of patients with false-positive results). Reclassifying Xpert-positive results with a very low semiquantitation level to Xpert negative improved the specificity (+3\% [95\% CI, +2 to +5\%]) but reduced the sensitivity (−10\% [95\% CI, −4 to −15\%]). Patients with previous TB retested with Xpert can have false-positive results and thus not require treatment. These data inform clinical practice by highlighting the challenges in interpreting Xpert-positive results, underscore the need for culture, and have implications for next-generation ultrasensitive tests.},

  abstract = {Introduction Understanding human mixing patterns relevant to infectious diseases spread through close contact is vital for modelling transmission dynamics and optimisation of disease control strategies. Mixing patterns in low-income countries like Malawi are not well understood. Methodology We conducted a social mixing survey in urban Blantyre, Malawi between April and July 2021 (between the 2nd and 3rd wave of COVID-19 infections). Participants living in densely-populated neighbourhoods were randomly sampled and, if they consented, reported their physical and non-physical contacts within and outside homes lasting at least 5 minutes during the previous day. Age-specific mixing rates were calculated, and a negative binomial mixed effects model was used to estimate determinants of contact behaviour. Results Of 1,201 individuals enrolled, 702 (58.5\%) were female, the median age was 15 years (interquartile range [IQR] 5-32) and 127 (10.6\%) were HIV-positive. On average, participants reported 10.3 contacts per day (range: 1-25). Mixing patterns were highly age-assortative, particularly those within the community and with skin-to-skin contact. Adults aged 20-49y reported the most contacts (median:11, IQR: 8-15) of all age groups; 38\% (95\%CI: 16-63) more than infants (median: 8, IQR: 5-10), who had the least contacts. Household contact frequency increased by 3\% (95\%CI 2-5) per additional household member. Unemployed participants had 15\% (95\%CI: 9-21) fewer contacts than other adults. Among long range ({$>$}30 meters away from home) contacts, secondary school children had the largest median contact distance from home (257m, IQR 78-761). HIV-positive status in adults {$>$}18 years-old was not associated with increased contact patterns (1\%, 95\%CI -9-12). During this period of relatively low COVID-19 incidence in Malawi, 301 (25.1\%) individuals stated that they had limited their contact with others due to COVID-19 precautions; however, their reported contacts were not fewer (8\%, 95\%CI 1-13). Conclusion In urban Malawi, contact rates, are high and age-assortative, with little behavioural change due to either HIV-status or COVID-19 circulation. This highlights the limits of contact-restriction-based mitigation strategies in such settings and the need for pandemic preparedness to better understand how contact reductions can be enabled and motivated.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Household survey data are collected by governments, international organizations, and companies to prioritize policies and allocate billions of dollars. Surveys are typically selected from recent census data; however, census data are often outdated or inaccurate. This paper describes how gridded population data might instead be used as a sample frame, and introduces the R GridSample algorithm for selecting primary sampling units (PSU) for complex household surveys with gridded population data. With a gridded population dataset and geographic boundary of the study area, GridSample allows a two-step process to sample "seed" cells with probability proportionate to estimated population size, then "grows" PSUs until a minimum population is achieved in each PSU. The algorithm permits stratification and oversampling of urban or rural areas. The approximately uniform size and shape of grid cells allows for spatial oversampling, not possible in typical surveys, possibly improving small area estimates with survey results. RESULTS: We replicated the 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in GridSample by sampling the WorldPop 2010 UN-adjusted 100~m~×~100~m gridded population dataset, stratifying by Rwanda's 30 districts, and oversampling in urban areas. The 2010 Rwanda DHS had 79 urban PSUs, 413 rural PSUs, with an average PSU population of 610 people. An equivalent sample in GridSample had 75 urban PSUs, 405 rural PSUs, and a median PSU population of 612 people. The number of PSUs differed because DHS added urban PSUs from specific districts while GridSample reallocated rural-to-urban PSUs across all districts. CONCLUSIONS: Gridded population sampling is a promising alternative to typical census-based sampling when census data are moderately outdated or inaccurate. Four approaches to implementation have been tried: (1) using gridded PSU boundaries produced by GridSample, (2) manually segmenting gridded PSU using satellite imagery, (3) non-probability sampling (e.g. random-walk, "spin-the-pen"), and random sampling of households. Gridded population sampling is in its infancy, and further research is needed to assess the accuracy and feasibility of gridded population sampling. The GridSample R algorithm can be used to forward this research agenda.},

Cases were identified by a screening question about prolonged cough and further diagnosed with sputum examination and a chest X-ray. RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of pulmonary TB among men was 90/100,000 (95\% CI 45-135/100,000) and among women 110/100,000 (95\% CI 63-157/100,000). Case detection in the district was estimated to 39\% (95\% CI 20-76\%) among men and 12\% (95\% CI 6-26\%) among women. CONCLUSION: TB prevalence was similar among men and women. Case detection among men and women was significantly lower than the reported national case detection of 80\%, and there was a significant underdetection of female cases. These findings warrant actions, and emphasize the need to perform similar studies in different contexts.},

We used one of Africa’s largest population-based prospective cohorts from rural KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, to measure the spatial variations in the prevalence of recently-diagnosed TB disease, and to quantify the impact of community coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on recently-diagnosed TB disease. We collected data on TB disease episodes from a population-based sample of 41,812 adult individuals between 2009 and 2015. Spatial clusters (‘hotspots’) of recently-diagnosed TB were identified using a space-time scan statistic. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to investigate the relationship between community ART coverage and recently-diagnosed TB. Spatial clusters of recently-diagnosed TB were identified in a region characterized by a high prevalence of HIV and population movement. Every percentage increase in ART coverage was associated with a 2\% decrease in the odds of recently-diagnosed TB (aOR\,=\,0.98, 95\% CI:0.97–0.99). We identified for the first time the clear occurrence of recently-diagnosed TB hotspots, and quantified potential benefit of increased community ART coverage in lowering tuberculosis, highlighting the need to prioritize the expansion of such effective population interventions targeting high-risk areas.},

BCG scar verification and tuberculin testing was performed for subjects aged 2 months and over, and chest radiography screening was done on subjects 10 years and older. Sputum samples were collected from individuals who were initially assessed to have abnormal chest radiographs to determine the prevalence of bacillary tuberculosis. Acid-fast smear by modified Kinyoun's technique and culture on Lowenstein Jensen were done to demonstrate Mycobacterium tuberculosis. RESULTS: The prevalence of active pulmonary TB was 42/1000 population. The prevalence of culture-positive and smear-positive cases was 8.1 and 3.1/1000, respectively. The prevalence was similar in urban and rural areas. CONCLUSION: Morbidity from TB remains high. Allowing for methodological differences from the survey in 1981-1983, the prevalence of active pulmonary TB was unchanged. There was only a minimal decrease, of 37\% for smear-positive cases and 25\% for culture-positive cases, in the 14-year interval.},

RESULTS: The prevalences of culture-positive and smear-positive tuberculosis were 17.5 +/- 2.3 (95\% CI 13.3-22.4) and 7.9 +/- 2.3 per thousand (95\% CI 2.611.5), respectively. Extrapolated to the total population, the rates in the urban poor settlements were 12.4 +/- 1.7 (95\% CI 9.6-16.2) and 5.6 +/- 1.6 per thousand population (95\% CI 1.3-8.3), respectively. The prevalence of active pulmonary tuberculosis in subjects aged 10 years or more was 66 +/- 5.6/1000 (95\% CI 55-77). The BCG vaccination rate was 72\%. The overall prevalence of tuberculosis infection was 66\%, and 39\% in those aged 5-9 years, corresponding to an annual risk of infection (ARI) of 6.5\%. CONCLUSION: The problem of tuberculosis was substantial in the urban poor settlements, and was appreciably worse than that in the general urban population.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diseases other than tuberculosis (TB) detected during chest X-ray screening is poorly described in sub-Saharan Africa. Computer-assisted digital chest X-ray technology is available for TB screening and has the potential to be a screening tool for non-communicable diseases as well. Low- and middle-income countries are in a transition period where the burden of non-communicable diseases is increasing, but health systems are mainly focused on addressing infectious diseases. METHODS: Participants were adults undergoing computer-assisted chest X-ray screening for tuberculosis in a community-wide tuberculosis prevalence survey in Blantyre, Malawi. Adults with abnormal radiographs by field radiographer interpretation were evaluated by a physician in a community-based clinic. X-ray classifications were compared to classifications of a random sample of normal chest X-rays by radiographer interpretation. Radiographic features were classified using WHO Integrated Management for Adult Illnesses (IMAI) guidelines. All radiographs taken at the screening tent were analysed by the Qure.ai qXR v2.0~software. RESULTS: 5\% (648/13,490) of adults who underwent chest radiography were identified to have an abnormal chest X-ray by the radiographer. 387 (59.7\%) of the participants attended the X-ray clinic, and another 387 randomly sampled normal X-rays were available for comparison. Participants who were referred to the community clinic had a significantly higher HIV prevalence than those who had been identified to have a normal CXR by the field radiographer (90 [23.3\%] vs. 43 [11.1\%] p-value {$<$} 0.001). The commonest radiographic finding was cardiomegaly (20.7\%, 95\% CI 18.0-23.7). One in five (81/387) chest X-rays were misclassified by the radiographer. The overall mean Qure.ai qXR v2.0~score for all reviewed X-rays was 0.23 (SD 0.20). There was a high concordance of cardiomegaly classification between the physician and the computer-assisted software (109/118, 92.4\%). CONCLUSION: There is a high burden of cardiomegaly on a chest X-ray at a community level, much of which is in patients with diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Cardiomegaly on chest X-ray may be a potential tool for screening for cardiovascular NCDs at the primary care level as well as in the community.},

  abstract = {Background Most countries have formally adopted the World Health Organization’s 2015 recommendation of universal HIV treatment (“treat all”). However, there are few rigorous assessments of the real-world impact of treat all policies on antiretroviral treatment (ART) uptake across different contexts. Methods and findings We used longitudinal data for 814,603 patients enrolling in HIV care between 1 January 2004 and 10 July 2018 in 6 countries participating in the global International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium: Burundi (N = 11,176), Kenya (N = 179,941), Malawi (N = 84,558), Rwanda (N = 17,396), Uganda (N = 96,286), and Zambia (N = 425,246). Using a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design, we assessed the change in the proportion initiating ART within 30 days of enrollment in HIV care (rapid ART initiation) after country-level adoption of the treat all policy. A modified Poisson model was used to identify factors associated with failure to initiate ART rapidly under treat all. In each of the 6 countries, over 60\% of included patients were female, and median age at enrollment ranged from 32 to 36 years. In all countries studied, national adoption of treat all was associated with large increases in rapid ART initiation. Significant increases in rapid ART initiation immediately after treat all policy adoption were observed in Rwanda, from 44.4\% to 78.9\% of patients (34.5 percentage points [pp], 95\% CI 27.2 to 41.7; p {$<$} 0.001), Kenya (25.7 pp, 95\% CI 21.8 to 29.5; p {$<$} 0.001), Burundi (17.7 pp, 95\% CI 6.5 to 28.9; p = 0.002), and Malawi (12.5 pp, 95\% CI 7.5 to 17.5; p {$<$} 0.001), while no immediate increase was observed in Zambia (0.4 pp, 95\% CI −2.9 to 3.8; p = 0.804) and Uganda (−4.2 pp, 95\% CI −9.0 to 0.7; p = 0.090). The rate of rapid ART initiation accelerated sharply following treat all policy adoption in Malawi, Uganda, and Zambia; slowed in Kenya; and did not change in Rwanda and Burundi. In post hoc analyses restricted to patients enrolling under treat all, young adults (16–24 years) and men were at increased risk of not rapidly initiating ART (compared to older patients and women, respectively). However, rapid ART initiation following enrollment increased for all groups as more time elapsed since treat all policy adoption. Study limitations include incomplete data on potential ART eligibility criteria, such as clinical status, pregnancy, and enrollment CD4 count, which precluded the assessment of rapid ART initiation specifically among patients known to be eligible for ART before treat all. Conclusions Our analysis indicates that adoption of treat all policies had a strong effect on increasing rates of rapid ART initiation, and that these increases followed different trajectories across the 6 countries. Young adults and men still require additional attention to further improve rapid ART initiation.},

  abstract = {Passive case finding, the detection of tuberculosis (TB) cases among persons presenting to health facilities with symptoms suggestive of TB, has remained the principal public health approach for TB diagnosis. While this approach, in combination with improved treatment, has led to substantial global progress, the overall epidemiological impact has been inadequate. Stagnating case notifications and sluggish decline in incidence prompt the pursuit of a more active approach to TB case detection. Screening among contacts of TB patients and people living with human immunodeficiency virus infection, long recommended, needs scaling up. Screening in other risk groups may also be considered, depending on the epidemiological situation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently produced recommendations on systematic screening for active TB, which set out principles and provide guidance on the prioritisation of risk groups for screening and choice of screening and diagnostic algorithms. With a view to help translate WHO recommendations into practice, this concluding article of the State of the Art series discusses programmatic approaches. Published literature is scanty. However, considerable field experience exists to draw important lessons. Cautioning against a hasty pursuit of active case finding, the article stresses that programmatic implementation of TB screening requires a systematic approach. Important considerations should include setting clear goals and objectives based on a thorough assessment of the situation; considering the place of TB screening in the overall approach to enhancing TB detection; identifying and prioritising risk groups; choosing appropriate screening and diagnostic algorithms; and pursuing setting-specific implementation strategies with engagement of relevant partners, due attention to ethical considerations and built-in monitoring and evaluation.},

So far, the scope of the problem in high burden TB countries is relatively unknown. Methods: Chronic respiratory symptoms (cough and phlegm lasting {$>$}2 weeks) and radiological lung abnormalities were compared between adults with and without a history of TB among the general population of Uganda. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate odds ratios with adjustment for age, gender, smoking, education, setting and region. Random effects models accounted for village clustering effect. Results: Of 45,293 invited people from 70 villages, 41,154 (90.9\%) participated in the survey. 798 had a history of TB and among them, 16\% had respiratory symptoms and 41\% x-ray abnormalities. Adjusted odds ratios showed strong evidence for individuals with a history of TB having increased risk of respiratory symptoms (OR=4·02, 95\%CI: 3·25-4·96) and x-ray abnormalities (OR=17·52, 95\%CI: 14·76-20·79); attributing 6\% and 24\% of the respective population risks. Conclusions: In Uganda, a history of TB was a strong predictor of respiratory symptoms and lung abnormalities, before older age and smoking. Eliminating TB disease could reduce the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms as much as eliminating smoking.},

The NTPs use their own surveillance data to assess TB control strategies. These data are not accurate enough to serve as valid epidemiological parameters. KNCV adds an epidemiological research component to the general TA. Epidemiological research does give the evidence-base needed for TB control. Embedding this research in continued programme support from TA consultants has been fruitful. This paper details KNCV's experiences with such TA plus epidemiological research approach, specially in conducting large-scale population-based surveys: tuberculin surveys, TB prevalence surveys, and drug resistance surveys. The lessons learned include the added value of long-term programme support, of a thorough knowledge of the survey's situational context, of in-country capacity building, and of guidelines for guiding, as opposed to dictating, research. van Leth and Klinkenberg; Licensee Bentham Open.},

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study in the Matlosana sub-district of North West Province, South Africa. METHODS: Contacts of index TB patients received TB and HIV testing after counseling at their first household visit and were then followed up a year later, in 2010. TB or HIV diagnoses that occurred during the period were determined. RESULTS: For 2,377 household contacts, the overall observed TB incidence rate was 1.3 per 100 person years (95\% CI 0.9-1.9/100py) and TB incidence for individuals who were HIV-infected and HIV seronegative at baseline was 5.4/100py (95\% CI 2.9-9.0/100py) and 0.7/100py (95\% CI 0.3-1.4/100py), respectively. The overall HIV incidence rate was 2.2/100py (95\% CI 1.3-8.4/100py). CONCLUSIONS: In the year following a household case finding visit when household contacts were tested for TB and HIV, the incidence rate of both active TB and HIV infection was found to be extremely high. Clearly, implementing proven strategies to prevent HIV acquisition and preventing TB transmission and progression to disease remains a priority in settings such as South Africa.},

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and the fraction attributable to HIV, and to evaluate case detection. METHODS: Residents aged 15 years and older, from 40 randomly sampled clusters, provided two sputum samples for microscopy; those with chest radiograph abnormalities or symptoms suggestive of PTB provided one additional sputum sample for culture. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PTB was defined by a culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis or two positive smears. Persons with PTB were offered HIV testing and interviewed on care-seeking behavior. We estimated the population-attributable fraction of HIV on prevalent and notified PTB, the patient diagnostic rate, and case detection rate using provincial TB notification data. Among 20,566 participants, 123 had PTB. TB prevalence was 6.0/1,000 (95\% confidence interval, 4.6-7.4) for all PTB and 2.5/1,000 (1.6-3.4) for smear-positive PTB. Of 101 prevalent TB cases tested, 52 (51\%) were HIV infected, and 58 (64\%) of 91 cases who were not on treatment and were interviewed had not sought care. Forty-eight percent of prevalent and 65\% of notified PTB cases were attributable to HIV. For smear-positive and smear-negative PTB combined, the patient diagnostic rate was 1.4 cases detected per person-year among HIV-infected persons having PTB and 0.6 for those who were HIV uninfected, corresponding to case detection rates of 56 and 65\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Undiagnosed PTB is common in this community. TB case finding needs improvement, for instance through intensified case finding with mobile smear microscopy services, rigorous HIV testing, and improved diagnosis of smear-negative TB.},

METHODS: A systematic search was undertaken of studies published between January 1, 2011 and October 1, 2019 in the English language. The proportion of contacts diagnosed with co-prevalent TB, incident TB and/or LTBI was estimated. Evaluation of the effectiveness of contact investigation included randomised trials, while the yield of contact investigation (co-prevalent and incident TB and LTBI) was assessed in non-randomised studies. RESULTS: Data were extracted from 244 studies, of which 187 studies measured the proportion of contacts diagnosed with TB disease and 135 studies measured LTBI prevalence. Individual randomised trials demonstrated that contact investigation increased TB case notification (RR 2.5 [95\% CI: 2.0-3.2]), TB case detection (OR 1.34 [95\% CI: 0.43-4.24]) and decreased mortality (RR 0.6 [95\% CI: 0.4-0.8]) and population TB prevalence (risk ratio 0.82 [95\% CI: 0.64-1.04]).The overall pooled prevalence of TB was 3.6\% (95\% CI: 3.3-4.0\%; I2=98.9\%, 181 studies). The pooled prevalence of microbiologically-confirmed TB was 3.2\% (95\% CI: 2.6-3.7\%; I2=99.5\%, 106 studies). The pooled incidence of TB was highest in the first year after exposure to index patients (2.0\%, 95\% CI: 1.1-3.3\%; I2=96.2\%, 14 studies) and substantially lower five years after exposure to index patient (0.5\%, 95\% CI: 0.3-0.9\%; 1 study). The pooled prevalence of LTBI among contacts was 42.4\% (95\% CI: 38.5-46.4\%; I2=99.8\%, 135 studies). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that contact investigation was effective in high-burden settings. The higher pooled prevalence estimates of microbiologically-confirmed TB compared to previous reviews suggests newer rapid molecular diagnostics contribute to increased case detection.},

Household contacts (HHCs) of persons with TB are a key population for targeting prevention and control interventions. We aimed to identify risk factors associated with developing TB among HHCs. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study among HHCs in eight provinces in Vietnam who were enrolled in a randomized control trial of active case finding for TB. Cases were any HHCs diagnosed and registered with TB within the Vietnam National TB programme during two years of follow-up. Controls were selected by simple random sampling from the remaining HHCs. Risk factor data were collected at enrolment and during follow-up. A logistic regression model was developed to determine predictors of TB among HHCs. RESULTS: We selected 1,254 HHCs for the analysis; 214 cases and 1,040 controls. Underlying characteristics varied between both groups; cases were older, more likely to be male, higher proportion of reported previous TB and diabetes. Risk factors associated with a TB diagnosis included being male (aOR 1.4; 95\% CI: 1.03-2.0), residing in an urban setting (aOR 1.8; 1.3-2.5), prior TB (aOR 4.6; 95\% CI: 2.5-8.7), history of diabetes (aOR 3.1; 95\% CI: 1.7-5.8), current smoking (aOR 3.1; 95\% CI: 2.2-4.4) and prolonged history of coughing in the source case at enrolment (OR 1.6; 95\% CI: 1.1-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: Household contacts remain and important key population for TB prevention and control. TB programmes should ensure effective contact investigations are implemented for household contacts, particularly those with additional risk factors for developing tuberculosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies show that tuberculosis notification declines with increasing altitude. This can be due to declining incidence or declining case detection. In Vietnam notification rates of new smear-positive tuberculosis in the central mountainous provinces (26/100,000 population) are considerably lower than in Vietnam in general (69/100,000 population). In order to clarify whether this is explained by low incidence or low case detection, we aimed to assess the prevalence of new smear-positive tuberculosis among adults with prolonged cough in three mountainous provinces in central Vietnam. METHODS: A house-to-house survey of persons ({$>$} or = 15 years) was carried out in twelve randomly selected districts in 2003. Three sputum specimens were microscopically examined of persons reporting a prolonged cough ({$>$} or = 3 weeks). Case detection was assessed by the ratio between notification and prevalence. RESULTS: Of 68,946 included persons (95\% response), 1,298 (1.9\% 95\%CI 1.8-2.2) reported a prolonged cough. Of these, eighteen were sputum smear-positive of whom two had had anti-tuberculosis treatment. The prevalence of new smear-positive tuberculosis was 27/100,000 (95\%CI 11-44/100,000) and the notification rate was 44/100,000 among persons {$>$} or = 15 years. The estimated case detection rate was 76\%. CONCLUSION: Low tuberculosis notification in this mountainous setting is probably a true reflection of low tuberculosis incidence. Possible causes for low incidence in mountainous areas include low transmission rates or altitude-related differences in pathology.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: TB persists despite being relatively easy to detect and cure because the journey from the onset of symptoms to cure involves a series of steps, with patients being lost to follow-up at each stage and delays occurring among patients not lost to follow-up. One cause of drop-off and delay occurs when patients delay or avoid returning to clinic to get their test results and start treatment. METHODS: We fielded two SMS interventions in three Cape Town clinics to see their effects on whether people returned to clinic, and how quickly. One was a simple reminder; the other aimed to overcome "optimism bias" by reminding people TB is curable and many millions die unnecessarily from it. Recruits were randomly assigned at the clinic level to a control group or one of the two SMS groups (1:2:2). In addition to estimating effects on the full sample, we also estimated effects on HIV-positive patients. RESULTS: SMS recipients were more likely to return to clinic in the requested two days than the control group. The effect was smaller in the intent-to-treat analysis (52/101 or 51.5\% vs. 251/405 or 62.0\%, p = 0.05) than in the per-protocol analysis (50/97 or 51.5\% vs. 204/318 or 64.2\%, p = 0.03). The effect was larger among HIV-positives (10/35 or 28.6\% vs. 97/149 or 65.1\%, p{$<$}0.01). The effects of SMS messages diminished as the interval increased: significant effects at the 5\% level were found at five and 10 days only among HIV-positives. The second SMS message had larger effects, albeit not significantly larger, likely due in part to lack of statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: At 2 U.S. cents per message, SMS reminders are an inexpensive option to encourage TB testers to return to clinic, especially when worded to counter optimism bias.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current tuberculosis treatments leave patients with clinically significant lung injury and increased all-cause mortality post-cure. Adjunctive host-directed therapies could protect the lungs, improve long-term survival, and shorten treatment duration; however, few have been tested clinically. Therefore, we aimed to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of four host-directed therapies for tuberculosis. METHODS: In this prospective, open-label, phase 2, randomised controlled trial, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited at three clinical sites in South Africa. Eligible patients were aged 18-65 years, HIV-1-negative, and had rifampicin-susceptible Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a sputum Xpert cycle threshold of less than 20, and moderately advanced or far advanced disease on chest radiography. By use of numbers generated in blocks of ten and stratification by site, eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1) to receive one of the four oral host-directed treatments plus standard tuberculosis treatment or standard treatment alone (the control group). Host-directed treatments were: CC-11050 (200 mg twice daily, taken with food; day 1-112); everolimus (0·5 mg/day; day 1-112); auranofin (3 mg/day for seven doses, then 6 mg/day; day 1-112); and ergocalciferol (5 mg on day 1, then 2·5 mg on day 28 and day 56). All study participants received oral rifabutin-substituted standard tuberculosis treatment for 180 days. Patients and clinicians were not masked to treatment assignment. Spirometry and sputum culture with solid and liquid media were done at baseline and up to 180 days at specified intervals throughout treatment. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability up to day 210. Secondary preliminary efficacy endpoints were treatment effects on sputum microbiology (culture status at day 56 and the hazard ratio for stable culture conversion up to day 180) and lung function (FEV1 and forced vital capacity [FVC]) measured by spirometry at day 56, day 180, and day 540. Safety was analysed in the intention-to-treat population and preliminary efficacy primarily in the per-protocol population. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02968927. Post-treatment follow-up was completed in 2020. FINDINGS: Between Nov 18, 2016, and Sept 27, 2018, 200 patients were screened and randomly assigned to different treatment groups (n=40 per group, apart from n=39 in the everolimus group after one patient withdrew consent). 11 treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred either during treatment or within 30 days after treatment discontinuation, of which three were attributable to a host-directed treatment. Life-threatening thrombocytopenia occurred in an auranofin recipient; apparent intra-abdominal sepsis leading to death occurred in another auranofin recipient and was classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction. Tuberculous spondylitis occurred as an apparent paradoxical reaction in a patient receiving ergocalciferol. Two patients in the control group had life-threatening, treatment-attributable liver injury. No treatment-emergent, treatment-attributable serious adverse events occurred in patients receiving CC-11050 or everolimus. Mean FEV1 in the control group was 61·7\% of predicted (95\% CI 56·3-67·1) at baseline and 69·1\% (62·3-75·8) at day 180. Patients treated with CC-11050 and everolimus had increased recovery of FEV1 at day 180 relative to the control group (mean difference from control group 6·30\%, 95\% CI 0·06-12·54; p=0·048; and 6·56\%, 0·18-12·95; p=0·044, respectively), whereas auranofin and ergocalciferol recipients did not. None of the treatments had an effect on FVC during 180 days of follow-up or on measures of sputum culture status over the course of the study. INTERPRETATION: CC-11050 and everolimus were safe and reasonably well tolerated as adjunctive therapies for tuberculosis, and analysis of preliminary efficacy suggests they might also enhance the recovery of FEV1, a key measure of lung function and predictor of all-cause mortality. Further studies of these candidates are warranted. FUNDING: The Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation and the South African Medical Research Council.},

We found in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, that schistosome infections were associated with transmission of HIV from adult men and women, and schistosome infections were also associated with increased HIV acquisition in adult women. We additionally found that schistosome infections were associated with death in HIV+ adult women. Since treatment of schistosome infections with praziquantel is inexpensive, effective, and safe, schistosomiasis prevention and treatment strategies may be a cost-effective way to reduce not only the symptoms associated with the infection, but also new cases of HIV and death among HIV+ persons. Though often viewed as an infection of predominantly rural areas and children, this study highlights that schistosomiasis prevention and treatment efforts are also needed in urban areas and among adults.},

China has rapidly scaled up HIV self-testing, creating an opportunity for integrated syphilis self-testing. However, there is a limited literature on implementing syphilis self-testing. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Chinese MSM in 2018. Participants completed a survey instrument including socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, syphilis self-testing, and HIV self-testing history. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify correlates of syphilis self-testing. We also recorded potential harms associated with syphilis self-testing. RESULTS: Six hundred ninety-nine MSM from 89 cities in 21 provinces in China completed the study. A total of 361/699 (51.7\%) men tested for syphilis, of whom 174/699 (24.9\%) men used syphilis self-testing. Among 174 who had self-tested, 90 (51.7\%) reported that the self-test was their first syphilis test, and 161 (92.5\%) reported that they undertook syphilis self-testing together with HIV self-testing. After adjusting for covariates, syphilis self-testing was correlated with disclosure of sexual orientation to family or friends (aOR: 1.90, 95\%CI: 1.32-2.73), reporting two to five male sexual partners (aOR: 1.81, 95\%CI: 1.04-3.16), HIV self-testing (aOR: 39.90, 95\%CI: 17.00-93.61), and never tested for syphilis in the hospital (aOR: 2.96, 95\%CI: 1.86-4.72). Self-reported harms associated with syphilis self-testing were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Scaling up syphilis self-testing could complement facility-based testing in China among MSM. Self-testing may increase first-time testing and has limited harms. Our findings suggest that syphilis self-testing could be integrated into HIV self-testing services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: China scaled up a tuberculosis control programme (based on the directly observed treatment, short-course [DOTS] strategy) to cover half the population during the 1990s, and to the entire population after 2000. We assessed the effect of the programme. METHODS: In this longitudinal analysis, we compared data from three national tuberculosis prevalence surveys done in 1990, 2000, and 2010. The 2010 survey screened 252,940 eligible individuals aged 15 years and older at 176 investigation points, chosen by stratified random sampling from all 31 mainland provinces. All individuals had chest radiographs taken. Those with abnormal radiographs, persistent cough, or both, were classified as having suspected tuberculosis. Tuberculosis was diagnosed by chest radiograph, sputum-smear microscopy, and culture. Trained staff interviewed each patient with tuberculosis. The 1990 and 2000 surveys were reanalysed and compared with the 2010 survey. FINDINGS: From 1990 to 2010, the prevalence of smear-positive tuberculosis decreased from 170 cases (95\% CI 166-174) to 59 cases (49-72) per 100,000 population. During the 1990s, smear-positive prevalence fell only in the provinces with the DOTS programme; after 2000, prevalence decreased in all provinces. The percentage reduction in smear-positive prevalence was greater for the decade after 2000 than the decade before (57\% vs 19\%; p{$<$}0.0001). 70\% of the total reduction in smear-positive prevalence (78 of 111 cases per 100,000 population) occurred after 2000. Of these cases, 68 (87\%) were in known cases-ie, cases diagnosed with tuberculosis before the survey. Of the known cases, the proportion treated by the public health system (using the DOTS strategy) increased from 59 (15\%) of 370 cases in 2000 to 79 (66\%) of 123 cases in 2010, contributing to reduced proportions of treatment default (from 163 [43\%] of 370 cases to 35 [22\%] of 123 cases) and retreatment cases (from 312 [84\%] of 374 cases to 48 [31\%] of 137 cases; both p{$<$}0.0001). INTERPRETATION: In 20 years, China more than halved its tuberculosis prevalence. Marked improvement in tuberculosis treatment, driven by a major shift in treatment from hospitals to the public health centres (that implemented the DOTS strategy) was largely responsible for this epidemiological effect.

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Scale-up of HIV self-testing (HIVST) will play a key role in meeting the United Nation's 90-90-90 targets. Delayed re-reading of used HIVST devices has been used by early implementation studies to validate the performance of self-test kits and to estimate HIV positivity among self-testers. We investigated the stability of results on used devices under controlled conditions to assess its potential as a quality assurance approach for HIVST scale-up. METHODS: 444 OraQuick((R)) HIV-1/2 rapid antibody tests were conducted using commercial plasma from two HIV-positive donors and HIV-negative plasma (high-reactive n = 148, weak-reactive n = 148 and non-reactive n = 148) and incubated them for six months under four conditions (combinations of high and low temperatures and humidity). Devices were re-read daily for one week, weekly for one subsequent month and then once a month by independent readers unaware of the  previous results. We used multistage transition models to investigate rates of change in device results, and between storage conditions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was a high incidence of device instability. Forty-three (29\%) of 148 initially non-reactive results became false weak-reactive results. These changes  were observed across all incubation conditions, the earliest on Day 4 (n = 9 kits). No initially HIV-reactive results changed to a non-reactive result. There  were no significant associations between storage conditions and hazard of results transition. We observed substantial statistical agreement between independent re-readers over time (agreement range: 0.74 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed re-reading of used OraQuick((R)) HIV-1/2 rapid antibody tests is not currently a  valid methodological approach to quality assurance and monitoring as we observed  a high incidence (29\%) of true non-reactive tests changing to false weak-reactive and therefore its use may overestimate true HIV positivity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains a global health challenge, with early diagnosis key to its reduction. Face-mask sampling detects exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We aimed to investigate bacillary output from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and to assess the potential of face-mask sampling as a diagnostic method in active case-finding. METHODS: We did a 24-h longitudinal study in patients from three hospitals in Pretoria, South Africa, with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients underwent 1 h of face-mask sampling eight times over a 24-h period, with contemporaneous sputum sampling. M tuberculosis was detected by quantitative PCR. We also did an active case-finding pilot study in inhabitants of an informal settlement near Pretoria. We enrolled individuals with symptoms of tuberculosis on the WHO screening questionnaire. Participants provided sputum and face-mask samples that were tested with the molecular assay Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra. Sputum-negative and face-mask-positive individuals were followed up prospectively for 20 weeks by bronchoscopy, PET-CT, and further sputum analysis to validate the diagnosis. FINDINGS: Between Sept 22, 2015, and Dec 3, 2015, 78 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis were screened for the longitudinal study, of whom 24 completed the study (20 had HIV co-infection). M tuberculosis was detected in 166 (86\%) of 192 face-mask samples and 38 (21\%) of 184 assessable sputum samples obtained over a 24-h period. Exhaled M tuberculosis output showed no diurnal pattern and did not associate with cough frequency, sputum bacillary content, or chest radiographic disease severity. On May 16, 2018, 45 individuals were screened for the prospective active case-finding pilot study, of whom 20 had tuberculosis symptoms and were willing to take part. Eight participants were diagnosed prospectively with pulmonary tuberculosis, of whom six were exclusively face-mask positive at screening. Four of these participants (three of whom were HIV-positive) had normal findings on chest radiography but had treatment-responsive early tuberculosis-compatible lesions on PET-CT scans, with Xpert-positive sputum samples after 6 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Face-mask sampling offers a highly efficient and non-invasive method for detecting exhaled M tuberculosis, informing the presence of active infection both with greater consistency and at an earlier disease stage than with sputum samples. The approach shows potential for diagnosis and screening, particularly in difficult-to-reach communities.

Being a contact of a patient with smear-positive TB with high ECM or being of Black Caribbean ethnicity was independently associated with greater odds of active TB disease (smear-positive vs. smear-negative, OR 5.3, 95\%CI 3.2-8.7; ECM-3 vs. ECM-0, OR 2.2, 95\%CI 1.01-5.0; Black Caribbean vs. White, OR 7.4, 95\%CI 2.1-25). Being a contact of a patient with smear-positive TB or of Black Caribbean ethnicity was also independently associated with greater odds of tuberculous infection (smear-positive vs. smear-negative, OR 5.3, 95\%CI 3.8-7.3; and Black Caribbean vs. White, OR 6.7, 95\%CI 2.0-25). CONCLUSIONS: The social complexity and ethnicity of patients were associated with tuberculous infection and TB disease in their contacts.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of socioeconomic support on tuberculosis preventive therapy initiation in household contacts of tuberculosis patients and on treatment success in patients. METHODS: A non-blinded, household-randomized, controlled study was performed between February 2014 and June 2015 in 32 shanty towns in Peru. It included patients being treated for tuberculosis and their household contacts. Households were randomly assigned to either the standard of care provided by Peru's national tuberculosis programme (control arm) or the same standard of care plus socioeconomic support (intervention arm). Socioeconomic support comprised conditional cash transfers up to 230 United States dollars per household, community meetings and household visits. Rates of tuberculosis preventive therapy initiation and treatment success (i.e. cure or treatment completion) were compared in intervention and control arms. FINDINGS: Overall, 282 of 312 (90\%) households agreed to participate: 135 in the intervention arm and 147 in the control arm. There were 410 contacts younger than 20~years: 43\% in the intervention arm initiated tuberculosis preventive therapy versus 25\% in the control arm (adjusted odds ratio, aOR:\,2.2; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 1.1-4.1). An intention-to-treat analysis showed that treatment was successful in 64\% (87/135) of patients in the intervention arm versus 53\% (78/147) in the control arm (unadjusted OR: 1.6; 95\% CI: 1.0-2.6). These improvements were equitable, being independent of household poverty. CONCLUSION: A tuberculosis-specific, socioeconomic support intervention increased uptake of tuberculosis preventive therapy and tuberculosis treatment success and is being evaluated in the Community Randomized Evaluation of a Socioeconomic Intervention to Prevent TB (CRESIPT) project.},

The participants, who were 15 years or older, were invited to participate at a mobile health camp. Medical history for HIV, tuberculosis, hypertension, and diabetes was established through a questionnaire. Blood pressure measurements, chest x-rays, and tests of blood and sputum were taken to estimate the population prevalence and geospatial distribution of HIV, active and lifetime tuberculosis, elevated blood glucose, elevated blood pressure, and combinations of these.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}17 118 adolescents and adults were recruited from May 25, 2018, to Nov 28, 2019, and assessed. Overall, 52·1\% (95\% CI 51·3–52·9) had at least one active disease. 34·2\% (33·5–34·9) had HIV, 1·4\% (1·2–1·6) had active tuberculosis, 21·8\% (21·2–22·4) had lifetime tuberculosis, 8·5\% (8·1–8·9) had elevated blood glucose, and 23·0\% (22·4–23·6) had elevated blood pressure. Appropriate treatment and optimal disease control was highest for HIV (78·1\%), and lower for elevated blood pressure (42·5\%), active tuberculosis (29·6\%), and elevated blood glucose (7·1\%). Disease prevalence differed notably by sex, across age groups, and geospatially: men had a higher prevalence of active and lifetime tuberculosis, whereas women had a substantially high prevalence of HIV at 30–49 years and an increasing prevalence of multiple and poorly controlled non-communicable diseases when older than 50 years.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We found a convergence of infectious and non-communicable disease epidemics in a rural South African population, with HIV well treated relative to all other diseases, but tuberculosis, elevated blood glucose, and elevated blood pressure poorly diagnosed and treated.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although failure of tuberculosis (TB) control in sub-Saharan Africa is attributed to the HIV epidemic, it is unclear why the directly observed therapy short-course (DOTS) strategy is insufficient in this setting. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of pulmonary TB (PTB) and HIV infection in a community of 13,000 with high HIV prevalence and high TB notification rate and a well-functioning DOTS TB control program. METHODS: Active case finding for PTB was performed in 762 adults using sputum microscopy and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture, testing for HIV, and a symptom and risk factor questionnaire. Survey findings were correlated with notification data extracted from the TB treatment register. RESULTS: Of those surveyed, 174 (23\%) tested HIV positive, 11 (7 HIV positive) were receiving TB therapy, 6 (5 HIV positive) had previously undiagnosed smear-positive PTB, and 6 (4 HIV positive) had smear-negative/culture-positive PTB. Symptoms were not a useful screen for PTB. Among HIV-positive and -negative individuals, prevalence of notified smear-positive PTB was 1,563/100,000 and 352/100,000, undiagnosed smear-positive PTB prevalence was 2,837/100,000 and 175/100,000, and case-finding proportions were 37 and 67\%, respectively. Estimated duration of infectiousness was similar for HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. However, 87\% of total person-years of undiagnosed smear-positive TB in the community were among HIV-infected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: PTB was identified in 9\% of HIV-infected individuals, with 5\% being previously undiagnosed. Lack of symptoms suggestive of PTB may contribute to low case-finding rates. DOTS strategy based on passive case finding should be supplemented by active case finding targeting HIV-infected individuals.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, self-reported HIV testing history and awareness of HIV-positive status from household surveys are used to estimate the percentage of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who know their HIV status. Despite widespread use, there is limited empirical information on the sensitivity of those self-reports, which can be affected by non-disclosure. METHODS: Bayesian latent class models were used to estimate the sensitivity of self-reported HIV testing history and awareness of HIV-positive status in four Population-based HIV Impact Assessment surveys in Eswatini, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia. Antiretroviral (ARV) metabolites biomarkers were used to identify persons on treatment who did not accurately report their status. For those without ARV biomarkers, the pooled estimate of non-disclosure among untreated persons was 1.48 higher than those on treatment. RESULTS: Among PLHIV, the model-estimated sensitivity of self-reported HIV testing history ranged from 96\% to 99\% across surveys. The model-estimated sensitivity of self-reported awareness of HIV status varied from 91\% to 97\%. Non-disclosure was generally higher among men and those aged 15-24 years. Adjustments for imperfect sensitivity did not substantially influence estimates of PLHIV ever tested (difference {$<$}4\%) but the proportion of PLHIV aware of their HIV-positive status was higher than the unadjusted proportion (difference {$<$}8\%). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported HIV testing histories in four Eastern and Southern African countries are generally robust although adjustment for non-disclosure increases estimated awareness of status. These findings can contribute to further refinements in methods for monitoring progress along the HIV testing and treatment cascade.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess an active case-finding strategy for the identification of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a rural district of Amhara Region, Ethiopia. METHODS: Study kebeles (smallest administrative units) were randomly selected in a cross-sectional study. House-to-house visits involving individuals aged {$>$}or=15 years in all households of the kebeles were conducted. The heads of households were asked to identify subjects with TB symptoms. Identified suspects were asked to provide three sputum samples for smear microscopy. RESULTS: Among the 47,478 individuals living in households that were screened, 1006 TB suspects and 38 cases were detected. This resulted in 38 cases of smear-positive TB, i.e., 80 per 100,000 population, using cluster sampling. The ratio of active vs. passive case detection was 2.5:1, indicating 2.5 undetected TB cases in the community for every smear-positive TB case receiving treatment during the survey period. A higher proportion of female patients was detected by the survey. CONCLUSION: The study revealed a very high proportion of undiagnosed TB. This indicates that the potential for a large infectious pool and significant transmission of TB in the community is high. The expansion of diagnostic facilities and the active involvement of health extension workers is necessary to expedite early detection, timely referral and treatment of TB.},

We evaluated whether C-reactive protein (CRP) possesses the necessary test characteristics to screen individuals for active pulmonary TB. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of CRP (cut-point of 10 mg/L) for pulmonary TB. We searched four databases for eligible articles published before January 31, 2015 and extracted data for individual studies. We synthesized data separately for outpatient and inpatient studies and generated pooled summary estimates (95\% CI) for sensitivity and specificity using random-effects meta-analysis. We performed pre-specified subgroup analyses to determine pooled summary estimates of CRP for diagnosis-seeking vs. screening populations and for patients with and without HIV infection. Findings We identified nine unique studies enrolling 1723 patients from the outpatient and inpatient setting. In the outpatient setting, CRP had high sensitivity (93\%, 95\% CI: 85–97) and moderate specificity (62\%, 95\% CI: 42–79) for active pulmonary TB. CRP was just as sensitive and specific for active pulmonary TB among patients with confirmed HIV-infection. Among hospitalized patients, specificity of CRP was poor (21\%, 95\% CI: 6–52). Interpretation CRP shows considerable promise as a tool to facilitate systematic screening for active TB, even among PLHIV. CRP-based TB screening should now be studied in other high-risk groups to determine the full impact of this simple and low-cost test.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a CD4 cell count before starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) to detect advanced HIV disease, and routine viral load (VL) testing following ART initiation to detect treatment failure. Donor support for CD4 testing has declined to prioritize access to VL monitoring. We examined trends in CD4 and VL testing among adults (≥15~years of age) starting ART in Southern Africa. METHODS: We analysed data from 14 HIV treatment programmes in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe in 2005 to 2018. We examined the frequency of CD4 and VL testing, the percentage of adults with CD4 or VL tests, and among those having a test, the percentage starting ART with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count {$<$}200~cells/mm3 ) or failing to suppress viral replication ({$>$}1000 HIV-RNA copies/mL) after ART initiation. We used mixed effect logistic regression to assess time trends adjusted for age and sex. RESULTS: Among 502,456 adults, the percentage with CD4 testing at ART initiation decreased from a high of 78.1\% in 2008 to a low of 38.0\% in 2017; the probability declined by 14\% each year (odds ratio (OR) 0.86; 95\% CI 0.86 to 0.86). Frequency of CD4 testing also declined. The percentage starting ART with advanced HIV disease declined from 83.3\% in 2005 to 23.5\% in 2018; each year the probability declined by 20\% (OR 0.80; 95\% CI 0.80 to 0.81). VL testing after starting ART varied; 61.0\% of adults in South Africa and 10.7\% in Malawi were tested, but fewer than 2\% were tested in the other four countries. The probability of VL testing after ART start increased only modestly each year (OR 1.06; 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.06). The percentage with unsuppressed VL was 8.6\%. There was no evidence of a decrease in unsuppressed VL over time (OR 1.00; 95\% CI 0.99 to 1.01). CONCLUSIONS: CD4 cell counting declined over time, including testing at the start of ART, despite the fact that many patients still initiated ART with advanced HIV disease. Without CD4 testing and expanded VL testing many patients with advanced HIV disease and treatment failure may go undetected, threatening the effectiveness of ART in sub-Saharan Africa.},

We know that isoniazid prophylaxis prevents TB in HIV-negative children following TB exposure, but there is uncertainty related to its role in TB preventive treatment in HIV-positive children. OBJECTIVES: To summarise the effects of TB preventive treatment versus placebo in HIV-positive children with no known TB contact on active TB, death, and reported adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase and two trial registers up to February 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included trials of HIV-positive children with and without known TB exposure, randomized to receive TB preventive treatment or placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently used the study selection criteria, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We assessed effects using risk, incidence rate and hazard ratios and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: We included three trials, involving 991 participants, below the age of 13 years, from South Africa and Botswana. Children were randomized to isoniazid prophylaxis or placebo, given daily or three times weekly. The median length of follow-up ranged from 5.7 to 34 months; some were on antiretroviral therapy (ART).In HIV-positive children not on ART, isoniazid prophylaxis may reduce the risk of active TB (hazard ratio (HR) 0.31, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.87; 1 trial, 240 participants, low certainty evidence), and death (HR 0.46, 95\% CI 0.22 to 0.95; 1 trial, 240 participants, low certainty evidence). One trial (182 participants) reported number of children with laboratory adverse events, which was similar between the isoniazid prophylaxis and placebo groups. No clinical adverse events were reported.In HIV-positive children on ART, we do not know if isoniazid prophylaxis reduces the risk of active TB (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95\% CI 0.50 to 1.14; 3 trials, 737 participants, very low certainty evidence) or death (RR 1.45, 95\% CI 0.78 to 2.72; 3 trials, 737 participants, very low certainty evidence). Two trials (714 participants) reported number of clinical adverse events and three trials (795 participants) reported number of laboratory adverse events; for both categories, the number of adverse events were similar between the isoniazid prophylaxis and placebo groups. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Isoniazid prophylaxis given to all children diagnosed with HIV may reduce the risk of active TB and death in HIV-positive children not on ART in studies from Africa. For children on ART, no clear benefit was detected. .},
