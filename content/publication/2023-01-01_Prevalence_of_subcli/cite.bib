  abstract = {People with subclinical tuberculosis (TB) have microbiological evidence of disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but either do not have or do not report TB symptoms. The relationship between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and subclinical TB is not yet well understood. We estimated the prevalence of subclinical pulmonary TB in household contacts of index TB patients in two South African provinces, and how this differed by HIV status.},
