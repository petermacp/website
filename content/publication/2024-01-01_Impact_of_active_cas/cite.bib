  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community active case finding (ACF) for tuberculosis was widely implemented in Europe and North America between 1940 and 1970, when incidence was comparable to many present-day high-burden countries. Using an interrupted time series analysis, we analysed the effect of the 1957 Glasgow mass chest X-ray campaign to inform contemporary approaches to screening.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Case notifications for 1950 to 1963 were extracted from public health records and linked to demographic data. We fitted Bayesian multilevel regression models to estimate annual relative case notification rates (CNRs) during and after a mass screening intervention implemented over 5 weeks in 1957 compared to the counterfactual scenario where the intervention had not occurred. We additionally estimated case detection ratios and incidence. From 11 March 1957 to 12 April 1957, 714,915 people (622,349 of 819,301 [76.0%] resident adults â‰¥15 years) were screened with miniature chest X-ray; 2,369 (0.4%) were diagnosed with tuberculosis. Pre-intervention (1950 to 1956), pulmonary CNRs were declining at 2.3% per year from a CNR of 222/100,000 in 1950. With the intervention in 1957, there was a doubling in the pulmonary CNR (RR: 1.95, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] [1.81, 2.11]) and 35% decline in the year after (RR: 0.65, 95% UI [0.59, 0.71]). Post-intervention (1958 to 1963) annual rates of decline (5.4% per year) were greater (RR: 0.77, 95% UI [0.69, 0.85]), and there were an estimated 4,599 (95% UI [3,641, 5,683]) pulmonary case notifications averted due to the intervention. Effects were consistent across all city wards and notifications declined in young children (0 to 5 years) with the intervention. Limitations include the lack of data in historical reports on microbiological testing for tuberculosis, and uncertainty in contributory effects of other contemporaneous interventions including slum clearances, introduction of BCG vaccination programmes, and the ending of postwar food rationing.
CONCLUSIONS: A single, rapid round of mass screening with chest X-ray (probably the largest ever conducted) likely resulted in a major and sustained reduction in tuberculosis case notifications. Synthesis of evidence from other historical tuberculosis screening programmes is needed to confirm findings from Glasgow and to provide insights into ongoing efforts to successfully implement ACF interventions in today's high tuberculosis burden countries and with new screening tools and technologies.},
