  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Undiagnosed HIV and schistosomiasis are highly prevalent among fishermen in the African Great Lakes region. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lakeside interventions integrating services for HIV and male genital schistosomiasis on the prevalence of schistosomiasis, uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, and voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC) among fishermen in Malawi.
METHODS: We conducted a three-arm, cluster-randomised trial in 45 lakeshore fishing communities (clusters) in Mangochi, Malawi. Clusters were defined geographically by their home community as the place where fishermen leave their boats (ie, a landing site). Eligible participants were male fishermen (aged ≥18 years) who resided in a cluster. Clusters were randomly allocated (1:1:1) through computer-generated random numbers to either enhanced standard of care (SOC), which offered invitation with information leaflets to a beach clinic offering HIV testing and referral, and presumptive treatment for schistosomiasis with praziquantel; peer education (PE), in which a nominated fisherman was responsible for explaining the study leaflet to promote services to his boat crew; or peer distribution education (PDE), in which the peer educator explained the leaflet and distributed HIV self-test kits to his boat crew. The beach clinic team and fishermen were not masked to intervention allocation; however, investigators were masked until the final analysis. Coprimary composite outcomes were the proportion of participants who had at least one Schistosoma haematobium egg observed on light microscopy from 10 mL of urine filtrate and the proportion who had self-reported initiating ART or scheduling VMMC by day 28. Outcomes were analysed by intention to treat; multiple imputation for missing outcomes was done; random-effect binomial models adjusting for baseline imbalance and clustering were used to compute unadjusted and adjusted risk differences, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs, and intracluster correlation coefficients for each outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN14354324.
FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2022, and Jan 29, 2023, 45 (65·2%) of 69 clusters assessed for eligibility were enrolled in the trial, with 15 clusters per arm. Of the 6036 fishermen screened at baseline, 5207 (86·3%) were eligible for participation: 1745 (87·6%) of 1991 in the enhanced SOC group, 1687 (81·9%) of 2061 in the PE group, and 1775 (89·5%) of 1984 in the PDE group. Compared with the prevalence of active schistosomiasis in the enhanced SOC group (292 [16·7%] of 1745), 241 (13·6%) of 1775 fishermen in the PDE group (adjusted RR 0·80 [95% CI 0·69-0·94]; p=0·0054) and 263 (15·6%) of 1687 fishermen in the PE group (0·92 [0·79-1·07]; p=0·28) had schistosomiasis at day 28. 230 (13·2%) in the enhanced SOC group, 281 (16·7%) in the PE group, and 215 (12·1%) in the PDE group initiated ART or were scheduled for VMMC. ART initiation or VMMC scheduling was not significantly increased with the PDE intervention (0·88 [0·74-1·05); p=0·15) and was marginally increased with the PE intervention (1·16 [0·99-1·37]; p=0·069) when compared with the enhanced SOC group. No serious adverse events were reported in this trial.
INTERPRETATION: We found weak evidence for the use of peer education to increase uptake of ART and VMMC, but strong evidence for the added distribution of HIV self-test kits to promote high engagement with services and reduce the prevalence of active schistosomiasis, suggesting a high potential for scale-up in hard-to-reach communities across Malawi.
