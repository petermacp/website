  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Household contact tracing for tuberculosis (TB) may facilitate TB diagnosis and identify individuals who may benefit from TB preventive therapy (TPT). In this cluster-randomised trial, we investigated whether household contact tracing and intensive TB/HIV screening would improve TB-free survival.
METHODS: Household contacts of index TB patients in two Provinces of South Africa were randomised to home tracing and intensive HIV/TB screening (sputum Xpert and culture; HIV testing with treatment linkage; and TPT, if eligible), or standard of care (SOC, clinic referral letters). The primary outcome was incident TB or death at 15-months. Secondary outcomes included tuberculin skin test (TST) positivity in children â‰¤14 years and undiagnosed HIV. (ISRCTN16006202).
RESULTS: From December 2016-March 2019, 1,032 index patients (4,459 contacts) and 1,030 (4,129 contacts) were randomised to the intervention and SOC arms. 3.2% (69/2166) of intervention arm contacts had prevalent microbiologically-confirmed TB. At 15-months, the cumulative incidence of TB or death did not differ between the intensive screening (93/3230, 2.9%) and SOC (80/2600, 3.1%) arms (hazard ratio: 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.24). TST positivity was higher in the intensive screening arm (38/845, 4.5%) compared to the SOC arm (15/800, 1.9%, odds ratio: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.07-4.72). Undiagnosed HIV was similar between arms (41/3185, 1.3% vs. 32/2543, 1.3%; odds ratio: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.64-1.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Household contact tracing with intensive screening and referral did not reduce incident TB or death. Providing referral letters to household contacts of index patients is an alternative strategy to home visits in high TB/HIV-prevalence settings.},
