abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Medication adherence is often suboptimal for adolescents with HIV, and establishing correct weight-based antiretroviral therapy dosing is difficult, contributing to virological failure. This review aimed to determine the proportion of adolescents achieving virological suppression after initiating ART. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies published between January 2004 and September 2014 including â‰¥50 adolescents taking ART and reporting on the proportion of virological suppressed participants were included. RESULTS: From a total of 5316 potentially relevant citations, 20 studies were included. Only eight studies reported the proportion of adolescents that were virologically suppressed at a specified time point. The proportion of adolescents with virological suppression at 12~months ranged from 27 to 89\%. CONCLUSION: Adolescent achievement of HIV virological suppression was highly variable. Improved reporting of virological outcomes from a wider range of settings is required to support efforts to improve HIV care and treatment for adolescents."
