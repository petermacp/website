abstract = "BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reduces bone mineral density, mineralisation and turnover, and may impair fracture healing. SETTING: This prospective cohort study in South Africa investigated whether HIV infection was associated with impaired fracture healing following trauma. METHODS: All adults with acute tibia and femur fractures who underwent intermedullary nailing (IM) for fracture fixation between September 2017 and December 2018, at two tertiary hospitals, were followed for a minimum of 12 months post-operatively. The primary outcome was delayed bone union at 6 months (defined by the radiological union scoring system for the tibia [RUST] score {$<$}9), and the secondary outcome was non-union (defined as RUST score {$<$}9) at 9 months. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to investigate associations between HIV status and impaired fracture healing. RESULTS: In total, 358 participants, who underwent 395 IM nailings, were enrolled in the study and followed up for 12 months. Seventy-one participants (71/358, 19·8\%) were HIV positive (83 IM nailings [83/395], 21.0\%). HIV was not associated with delayed fracture healing after IM nailing of the tibia or femur (multivariable odds ratio [OR]: 1·06; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0·50-2·22). Participants with HIV had a statistically significant lower odds of non-union compared to HIV-negative participants (multivariable OR: 0·17; 95\% CI: 0·01-0·92). CONCLUSIONS: Fractures sustained in HIV-positive individuals can undergo surgical fixation as effectively as those in individuals who are HIV negative, with no increased risk of delayed union or non-union."
