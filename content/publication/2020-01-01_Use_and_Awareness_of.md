abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many southern African countries are nearing the global goal of diagnosing 90\% of people with HIV by 2020. In 2016, 84 and 86\% of people with HIV knew their status in Malawi and Zimbabwe, respectively. However, gaps remain, particularly among men. We investigated awareness and use of, and willingness to self-test for HIV and explored sociodemographic associations before large-scale implementation. METHODS: We pooled responses from two of the first cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys to include HIV self-testing (HIVST) questions in Malawi and Zimbabwe in 2015-16. We investigated sociodemographic factors and sexual risk behaviours associated with previously testing for HIV, and past use, awareness of, and future willingness to self-test using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for the sample design and limiting analysis to participants with a completed questionnaire and valid HIV test result. We restricted analysis of willingness to self-test to Zimbabwean men, as women and Malawians were not systematically asked this question. RESULTS: Of 31,385 individuals, 31.2\% of men had never tested compared with 16.5\% of women (p~{$<$}\,0.001). For men, the likelihood of having ever tested increased with age. Past use and awareness of HIVST was very low, 1.2 and 12.6\%, respectively. Awareness was lower among women than men (9.1\% vs 15.3\%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\,=\,1.55; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.75), and at younger ages, and lower education and literacy levels. Willingness to self-test among Zimbabwean men was high (84.5\%), with greater willingness associated with having previously tested for HIV, being at high sexual risk (highest willingness [aOR\,=\,3.74; 95\%CI: 1.39-10.03, p~{$<$}\,0.009]), and being â‰¥25\,years old. Wealthier men had greater awareness of HIVST than poorer men (p~{$<$}\,0.001). The highest willingness to self-test (aOR\,=\,3.74; 95\%CI: 1.39-10.03, p~{$<$}\,0.009) was among men at high HIV-related sexual risk. CONCLUSIONS: In 2015-16, many Malawian and Zimbabwean men had never tested for HIV. Despite low awareness and minimal HIVST experience, willingness to self-test was high among Zimbabwean men, especially older men with moderate-to-high HIV-related sexual risk. These data provide a valuable baseline against which to investigate population-level uptake of HIVST as programmes scale up. Programmes introducing, or planning to introduce, HIVST should consider including relevant questions in population-based surveys."
