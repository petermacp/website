  abstract = {BackgroundMore new infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) occur annually in the WHO African region than in the rest of the world combined. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in pregnant women and vertical transmission events in the region.MethodsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Africa Index Medicus, and Africa Journals Online for publications between Jan 1, 1992, and Jan 7, 2024, with no language restrictions. HBsAg prevalence and vertical transmission (HBsAg positivity in children aged 6-12 months) were estimated with the use of binomial mixed models with logit links, stratified by infant vaccination status. We estimated HBsAg prevalence for subregions of Africa and for the WHO African region by weighting by estimated livebirths for each subregion. We estimated transmission events using WHO and UNICEF vaccine coverage data and UN population estimates.FindingsWe included 113 studies reporting on HBsAg prevalence from 190 983 pregnant women and 11 studies reporting on vertical transmission. HBsAg prevalence in women receiving antenatal care in the WHO African region (based on 2014-23 data) was 6·2% (95% CI 5·3-7·2). No relationship between risk of bias and HBsAg prevalence was observed. In 2022, an estimated 172 000 vertical transmission events (95% CI 82 000-383 000) occurred (0·4% of livebirths), a fall from a peak of 339 000 (149 000-634 000; 1·2% of all livebirths) in 2001. Increasing birth dose vaccination coverage to the WHO target of 90% could reduce vertical transmission by 43·7% (95% CI 11·6-78·0) to 97 000 events per year (95% CI 58 000-160 000). Adding maternal antiviral prophylaxis with 90% coverage could reduce transmission by 86·3% (95% CI 78·4-94·6) to 24 000 events per year (95% CI 14 000-39 000; 0·06% of livebirths) and achieve WHO elimination targets.InterpretationVertical transmission is an important contributor to HBV transmission in the WHO African region. Scaling up of hepatitis B birth dose vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis is urgently needed, which could achieve elimination of vertical transmission.FundingWellcome Trust.},
