	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: HIV and tuberculosis (TB) remain leading causes of preventable death in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HIV testing for all individuals with TB symptoms, but implementation has been suboptimal. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analyses to estimate HIV and TB prevalence, and short-term (two to six months) mortality, among adults with TB symptoms at community- and facility level.
METHODS: We searched Embase, Global Health and MEDLINE databases, and reviewed conference abstracts for studies reporting simultaneous HIV and TB screening of adults in LMICs published between January 2003 and December 2017. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate prevalence of HIV, undiagnosed TB and mortality risk at different health system levels.
RESULTS: Sixty-two studies including 260,792 symptomatic adults were identified, mostly from Africa and Asia. Median HIV prevalence was 19.2\% (IQR: 8.3\% to 40.4\%) at community level, 55.7\% (IQR: 20.9\% to 71.2\%) at primary care level and 80.7\% (IQR: 73.8\% to 84.6\%) at hospital level. Median TB prevalence was 6.9\% (IQR: 3.3\% to 8.4\%) at community, 20.5\% (IQR: 11.7\% to 46.4\%) at primary care and 36.4\% (IQR: 22.9\% to 40.9\%) at hospital level. Median short-term mortality was 22.6\% (IQR: 15.6\% to 27.7\%) among inpatients, 3.1\% (IQR: 1.2\% to 4.2\%) at primary care and 1.6\% (95\% CI: 0.45 to 4.13, n = 1 study) at community level.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with TB symptoms have extremely high prevalence of HIV infection, even when identified through community surveys. TB prevalence and mortality increased substantially at primary care and inpatient level respectively. Strategies to expand symptom-based TB screening combined with HIV and TB testing for all symptomatic individuals should be of the highest priority for both disease programmes in LMICs with generalized HIV epidemics. Interventions to reduce short-term mortality are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Outbreaks linked to cosmetic piercing are rare, but can cause significant illness. We report the investigation and management of a point-source outbreak that occurred during a Black Friday promotional event in North West England.
Methods: Outbreak investigation was led by Public Health England, and included active case finding among individuals pierced at a piercing premises between 25/11/2016 (Black Friday) and 7/12/2016. Detailed epidemiological, environmental (including inspection and sampling), and microbiological investigation was undertaken.
Results: During the Black Friday event (25/11/2016), 45 people were pierced (13 by a newly-appointed practitioner). Eleven cases were identified (7 microbiologically-confirmed, 2 probable, and 2 possible). All cases had clinical signs of infection around piercing sites, and five required surgical intervention, with varying degrees of post-operative disfigurement. All confirmed and probable cases had a scaffold piercing placed with a guide bar by the newly-appointed practitioner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indistinguishable at nine-locus variable-number tandem repeat loci, was isolated from four of the confirmed cases, and from pre- and post-flush samples from five separate water taps (three sinks) in the premises. Water samples taken after remedial plumbing work confirmed elimination of Pseudomonas contamination.
Discussion: Although high levels of Pseudomonas water contamination and some poor infection control procedures were identified, infection appeared to require additional exposure to an inexperienced practitioner, and the more invasive scaffold piercing. A proactive collaborative approach between piercers and health and environmental officials is required to reduce outbreak risk, particularly when unusually large events are planned.},

	abstract = {Background: Human immunodeficiency virus self-testing (HIVST) is effective, with scale-up underway in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed cost-effectiveness of adding HIVST to existing facility-based HIV testing and counseling (HTC) services. Both 2010 (initiate at CD4 {\textless}350 cells/μL) and 2015 (initiate all) World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for antiretroviral treatment (ART) were considered.
Methods: A microsimulation model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness, from both health provider and societal perspectives, of an HIVST service implemented in a cluster-randomized trial (CRT; ISRCTN02004005) in Malawi. Costs and health outcomes were evaluated over a 20-year time horizon, using a discount rate of 3\%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for parameter uncertainty.
Results: From the health provider perspective and 20-year time horizon, facility HTC using 2010 WHO ART guidelines was the least costly (\$294.71 per person; 95\% credible interval [CrI], 270.79-318.45) and least effective (11.64 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] per person; 95\% CrI, 11.43-11.86) strategy. Compared with this strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for facility HTC using 2015 WHO ART guidelines was \$226.85 (95\% CrI, 198.79-284.35) per QALY gained. The strategy of facility HTC plus HIVST, using 2010 WHO ART guidelines, was extendedly dominated. The ICER for facility HTC plus HIVST, using 2015 WHO ART guidelines, was \$253.90 (95\% CrI, 201.71-342.02) per QALY gained compared with facility HTC and using 2015 WHO ART guidelines.
Conclusions: HIVST may be cost-effective in a Malawian population with high HIV prevalence. HIVST is suited to an early HIV diagnosis and treatment strategy.

SETTING: HIV clinics in Blantyre, Malawi.
METHODS: Consecutive HIV-positive participants, diagnosed by HIVST or facility-based HTC as part of a community cluster-randomized trial (ISRCTN02004005), were followed from initial assessment for ART until 1-year postinitiation. Healthcare resource use was prospectively measured, and primary costing studies undertaken to estimate total health provider costs. Participants were interviewed to establish direct nonmedical and indirect costs over the first year of ART. Costs were adjusted to 2014 US\$ and INT\$. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D at each clinic visit. Multivariable analyses estimated predictors of economic outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 325 participants attending HIV clinics for assessment for ART, 265 were identified through facility-based HTC, and 60 through HIVST; 168/265 (69.2\%) and 36/60 (60.0\%), respectively, met national ART eligibility criteria and initiated treatment. The mean total health provider assessment costs for ART initiation were US\$22.79 (SE: 0.56) and US\$19.92 (SE: 0.77) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively, and was US\$2.87 (bootstrap 95\% CI: US\$1.01 to US\$4.73) lower for the HIVST group. The mean total health provider costs for the first year of ART were US\$168.65 (SE: 2.02) and US\$164.66 (SE: 4.21) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively, and comparable between the 2 groups (bootstrap 95\% CI: -US\$12.38 to US\$4.39). EQ-5D utility scores immediately before and one year after ART initiation were comparable between the 2 groups. EQ-5D utility scores 1 year after ART initiation had increased by 0.129 (SE: 0.011) and 0.139 (SE: 0.027) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Once HIV self-testers are linked into HIV services, their economic outcomes are comparable to those linking to services after facility-based HTC.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There was a large outbreak of measles in Liverpool, UK, in 2012-2013, despite measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation uptake rates that were higher than the national average. We estimated measles susceptibility of a cohort of children born in Liverpool between 1995 and 2012 to understand whether there was a change in susceptibility before and after the outbreak and to inform vaccination strategy.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The city of Liverpool, North West UK.
PARTICIPANTS: All children born in Liverpool (72 101) between 1995 and 2012 inclusive who were identified using the Child Health Information System (CHIS) and were still resident within Liverpool in 2014.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated cohort age-disaggregated and neighbourhood-disaggregated measles susceptibility according to WHO thresholds before and after the outbreak for children aged 1-17 years.
RESULTS: Susceptibility to measles was above WHO elimination thresholds before and after the measles outbreak in the 10+ age group. The proportion of children susceptible before and after outbreak, respectively: age 1-4 years 15.0\% before and 14.9\% after; age 5-9 years 9.9\% before and 7.7\% after; age 10+ years 8.6\% before and 8.5\% after. Despite an intensive MMR immunisation catch-up campaign after the 2012-2013 measles outbreak, the overall proportion of children with no MMR remains high at 6.1\% (4390/72 351). Across all age groups and before and after the outbreak, measles susceptibility was clustered by neighbourhood, with deprived areas having the greatest proportion of susceptible children.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sustained measles outbreaks remains, especially as large pools of susceptible older children will start leaving secondary education and continue to aggregate in higher education, employment and other community settings and institutions resulting in the potential for a propagated measles outbreak.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) case notification rates are usually higher in men than in women, but notification data are insufficient to measure sex differences in disease burden. This review set out to systematically investigate whether sex ratios in case notifications reflect differences in disease prevalence and to identify gaps in access to and/or utilisation of diagnostic services.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In accordance with the published protocol (CRD42015022163), TB prevalence surveys in nationally representative and sub-national adult populations (age ≥ 15 y) in low- and middle-income countries published between 1 January 1993 and 15 March 2016 were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; review of abstracts; and correspondence with the World Health Organization. Random-effects meta-analyses examined male-to-female (M:F) ratios in TB prevalence and prevalence-to-notification (P:N) ratios for smear-positive TB. Meta-regression was done to identify factors associated with higher M:F ratios in prevalence and higher P:N ratios. Eighty-three publications describing 88 surveys with over 3.1 million participants in 28 countries were identified (36 surveys in Africa, three in the Americas, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 in South-East Asia and 17 in the Western Pacific). Fifty-six surveys reported in 53 publications were included in quantitative analyses. Overall random-effects weighted M:F prevalence ratios were 2.21 (95\% CI 1.92-2.54; 56 surveys) for bacteriologically positive TB and 2.51 (95\% CI 2.07-3.04; 40 surveys) for smear-positive TB. M:F prevalence ratios were highest in South-East Asia and in surveys that did not require self-report of signs/symptoms in initial screening procedures. The summary random-effects weighted M:F ratio for P:N ratios was 1.55 (95\% CI 1.25-1.91; 34 surveys). We intended to stratify the analyses by age, HIV status, and rural or urban setting; however, few studies reported such data.
CONCLUSIONS: TB prevalence is significantly higher among men than women in low- and middle-income countries, with strong evidence that men are disadvantaged in seeking and/or accessing TB care in many settings. Global strategies and national TB programmes should recognise men as an underserved high-risk group and improve men's access to diagnostic and screening services to reduce the overall burden of TB more effectively and ensure gender equity in TB care.},

DESIGN: A quality assurance study of OraQuick (OraSure), Determine HIV 1/2™ (Alere) and Uni-Gold™ (Recombigen®).
METHODS: Consecutive adults (≥18y) attending Ndirande Health Centre in urban Blantyre, Malawi in January to April 2012 underwent HIV testing with two of each of the three rapid diagnostic test kits stored for 28 days at either 18°C (optimally-stored) or at 37°C (pre-incubated). Used OraQuick test kits were stored in a laboratory for delayed day 1 and subsequent monthly re-reading was undertaken for one year.
RESULTS: Of 378 individuals who underwent parallel testing, 5 (1.3\%) were dropped from the final analysis due to discordant or missing reference standard results (optimally-stored Determine and Uni-Gold). Compared to the diagnostic reference standard, OraQuick had a sensitivity of 97.2\% (95\% CI: 93.6-99.6). There were 7 false negative results among all test kits stored at 37°C and three false negatives among optimally stored kits. Excellent agreement between pre-incubated tests and optimally-stored tests with Kappa values of 1.00 for Determine and Uni-Gold; and 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.95; 1.00) for OraQuick were observed. There was high visual stability on re-reading of OraQuick, with only 1/375 pre-incubated and 1/371 optimally-stored OraQuick kits changing from the initial result over 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Erroneous results observed during HIV testing in low income settings are likely to be due to factors other than suboptimal storage conditions. Re-reading returned OraQuick kits may offer a convenient and accurate quality assurance approach, including in HIV self-testing programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A discordant immune response (DIR) is a failure to satisfactorily increase CD4 counts on ART despite successful virological control. Literature on the clinical effects of DIR has not been systematically evaluated. We aimed to summarise the risk of mortality, AIDS and serious non-AIDS events associated with DIR with a systematic review.
METHODS: The protocol is registered with the Centre for Review Dissemination, University of York (registration number CRD42014010821). Included studies investigated the effect of DIR on mortality, AIDS, or serious non-AIDS events in cohort studies or cohorts contained in arms of randomised controlled trials for adults aged 16 years or older. DIR was classified as a suboptimal CD4 count (as defined by the study) despite virological suppression following at least 6 months of ART. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to December 2015. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in cohort studies. Two authors applied inclusion criteria and one author extracted data. Risk ratios were calculated for each clinical outcome reported.
RESULTS: Of 20 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 14 different definitions of DIR were used. Risk ratios for mortality in patients with and without DIR ranged between 1.00 (95\% CI 0.26 to 3.92) and 4.29 (95\% CI 1.96 to 9.38) with the majority of studies reporting a 2 to 3 fold increase in risk.
CONCLUSIONS: DIR is associated with a marked increase in mortality in most studies but definitions vary widely. We propose a standardised definition to aid the development of management options for DIR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current tuberculosis diagnostics lack sensitivity, and are expensive. Highly accurate, rapid and cheaper diagnostic tests are required for point of care use in low resource settings with high HIV prevalence.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the sensitivity and specificity, and cost of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for tuberculosis diagnosis in adults with chronic cough compared to Xpert® MTB/RIF, fluorescence smear microscopy.
METHODS: Between October 2013 and March 2014, consecutive adults at a primary care clinic were screened for cough, offered HIV testing and assessed for tuberculosis using LAMP, Xpert® MTB/RIF and fluorescence smear microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity (with culture as reference standard), and costs were estimated.
RESULTS: Of 273 adults recruited, 44.3\% (121/273) were HIV-positive and 19.4\% (53/273) had bacteriogically confirmed tuberculosis. The sensitivity of LAMP compared to culture was 65.0\% (95\% CI: 48.3\% to 79.4\%) with 100\% (95\% CI: 98.0\% to 100\%) specificity. The sensitivity of Xpert® MTB/RIF (77.5\%, 95\% CI: 61.5\% to 89.2\%) was similar to that of LAMP, p = 0.132. The sensitivity of concentrated fluorescence smear microscopy with routine double reading (87.5\%, 95\% CI: 73.2\% to 95.8\%) was higher than that of LAMP, p = 0.020. All three tests had high specificity. The lowest cost per test of LAMP was at batch size of 14 samples (US\$ 9.98); this was lower than Xpert® MTB/RIF (US\$ 13.38) but higher than fluorescence smear microscopy (US\$ 0.65).
CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of LAMP was similar to Xpert® MTB/RIF but lower than fluorescence smear microscopy; all three tests had high specificity. These findings support the Malawi policy that recommends a combination of fluorescence smear microscopy and Xpert® MTB/RIF prioritised for people living with HIV, already found to be smear-negative, or being considered for retreatment of tuberculosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV self-testing (HIVST) has been found to be highly effective, but no cost analysis has been undertaken to guide the design of affordable and scalable implementation strategies.
METHODS: Consecutive HIV self-testers and facility-based testers were recruited from participants in a community cluster-randomised trial ( ISRCTN02004005 ) investigating the impact of offering HIVST in addition to facility-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC). Primary costing studies were undertaken of the HIVST service and of health facilities providing HTC to the trial population. Costs were adjusted to 2014 US\$ and INT\$. Recruited participants were asked about direct non-medical and indirect costs associated with accessing either modality of HIV testing, and additionally their health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D.
RESULTS: A total of 1,241 participants underwent either HIVST (n = 775) or facility-based HTC (n = 446). The mean societal cost per participant tested through HIVST (US\$9.23; 95 \% CI: US\$9.14-US\$9.32) was lower than through facility-based HTC (US\$11.84; 95 \% CI: US\$10.81-12.86). Although the mean health provider cost per participant tested through HIVST (US\$8.78) was comparable to facility-based HTC (range: US\$7.53-US\$10.57), the associated mean direct non-medical and indirect cost was lower (US\$2.93; 95 \% CI: US\$1.90-US\$3.96). The mean health provider cost per HIV positive participant identified through HIVST was higher (US\$97.50) than for health facilities (range: US\$25.18-US\$76.14), as was the mean cost per HIV positive individual assessed for anti-retroviral treatment (ART) eligibility and the mean cost per HIV positive individual initiated onto ART. In comparison to the facility-testing group, the adjusted mean EQ-5D utility score was 0.046 (95 \% CI: 0.022-0.070) higher in the HIVST group.
CONCLUSIONS: HIVST reduces the economic burden on clients, but is a costlier strategy for the health provider aiming to identify HIV positive individuals for treatment. The provider cost of HIVST could be substantially lower under less restrictive distribution models, or if costs of oral fluid HIV test kits become comparable to finger-prick kits used in health facilities.},

RESULTS: From a total of 5316 potentially relevant citations, 20 studies were included. Only eight studies reported the proportion of adolescents that were virologically suppressed at a specified time point. The proportion of adolescents with virological suppression at 12 months ranged from 27 to 89\%.
CONCLUSION: Adolescent achievement of HIV virological suppression was highly variable. Improved reporting of virological outcomes from a wider range of settings is required to support efforts to improve HIV care and treatment for adolescents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC) achieves high uptake, but is difficult and expensive to implement and sustain. We investigated a novel alternative based on HIV self-testing (HIVST). The aim was to evaluate the uptake of testing, accuracy, linkage into care, and health outcomes when highly convenient and flexible but supported access to HIVST kits was provided to a well-defined and closely monitored population.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following enumeration of 14 neighbourhoods in urban Blantyre, Malawi, trained resident volunteer-counsellors offered oral HIVST kits (OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test) to adult (≥16 y old) residents (n = 16,660) and reported community events, with all deaths investigated by verbal autopsy. Written and demonstrated instructions, pre- and post-test counselling, and facilitated HIV care assessment were provided, with a request to return kits and a self-completed questionnaire. Accuracy, residency, and a study-imposed requirement to limit HIVST to one test per year were monitored by home visits in a systematic quality assurance (QA) sample. Overall, 14,004 (crude uptake 83.8\%, revised to 76.5\% to account for population turnover) residents self-tested during months 1-12, with adolescents (16-19 y) most likely to test. 10,614/14,004 (75.8\%) participants shared results with volunteer-counsellors. Of 1,257 (11.8\%) HIV-positive participants, 26.0\% were already on antiretroviral therapy, and 524 (linkage 56.3\%) newly accessed care with a median CD4 count of 250 cells/μl (interquartile range 159-426). HIVST uptake in months 13-24 was more rapid (70.9\% uptake by 6 mo), with fewer (7.3\%, 95\% CI 6.8\%-7.8\%) positive participants. Being "forced to test", usually by a main partner, was reported by 2.9\% (95\% CI 2.6\%-3.2\%) of 10,017 questionnaire respondents in months 1-12, but satisfaction with HIVST (94.4\%) remained high. No HIVST-related partner violence or suicides were reported. HIVST and repeat HTC results agreed in 1,639/1,649 systematically selected (1 in 20) QA participants (99.4\%), giving a sensitivity of 93.6\% (95\% CI 88.2\%-97.0\%) and a specificity of 99.9\% (95\% CI 99.6\%-100\%). Key limitations included use of aggregate data to report uptake of HIVST and being unable to adjust for population turnover.
CONCLUSIONS: Community-based HIVST achieved high coverage in two successive years and was safe, accurate, and acceptable. Proactive HIVST strategies, supported and monitored by communities, could substantially complement existing approaches to providing early HIV diagnosis and periodic repeat testing to adolescents and adults in high-HIV settings.},

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of service delivery interventions to improve adolescents' linkage from HIV diagnosis to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, retention in HIV care and adherence to ART.
METHODS: We systematically searched the Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Sciences databases and conference abstracts from the International AIDS Conference and International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA). Studies published in English between 1st January 2001 and 9th June 2014 were included. Two authors independently evaluated reports for eligibility, extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Eleven studies from nine countries were eligible for review. Three studies were randomised controlled trials. Interventions assessed included individual and group counselling and education; peer support; directly observed therapy; financial incentives; and interventions to improve the adolescent-friendliness of clinics. Most studies were of low to moderate methodological quality.
CONCLUSIONS: This review identified limited evidence on the effectiveness of service delivery interventions to support adolescents' linkage from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation, retention on ART and adherence to ART. Although recommendations are qualified because of the small numbers of studies and limited methodological quality, offering individual and group education and counselling, financial incentives, increasing clinic accessibility and provision of specific adolescent-tailored services appear promising interventions and warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Self-testing for HIV infection may contribute to early diagnosis of HIV, but without necessarily increasing antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether offering optional home initiation of HIV care after HIV self-testing might increase demand for ART initiation, compared with HIV self-testing accompanied by facility-based services only.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial conducted in Blantyre, Malawi, between January 30 and November 5, 2012, using restricted 1:1 randomization of 14 community health worker catchment areas. Participants were all adult (≥16 years) residents (n = 16,660) who received access to home HIV self-testing through resident volunteers. This was a second-stage randomization of clusters allocated to the HIV self-testing group of a parent trial.
INTERVENTIONS: Clusters were randomly allocated to facility-based care or optional home initiation of HIV care (including 2 weeks of ART if eligible) for participants reporting positive HIV self-test results.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The preplanned primary outcome compared between groups the proportion of all adult residents who initiated ART within the first 6 months of HIV self-testing availability. Secondary outcomes were uptake of HIV self-testing, reporting of positive HIV self-test results, and rates of loss from ART at 6 months.
RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of adults in the home group initiated ART (181/8194, 2.2\%) compared with the facility group (63/8466, 0.7\%; risk ratio [RR], 2.94, 95\% CI, 2.10-4.12; P {\textless} .001). Uptake of HIV self-testing was high in both the home (5287/8194, 64.9\%) and facility groups (4433/8466, 52.7\%; RR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.58; P = .10). Significantly more adults reported positive HIV self-test results in the home group (490/8194 [6.0\%] vs the facility group, 278/8466 [3.3\%]; RR, 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.16-2.97; P = .006). After 6 months, 52 of 181 ART initiators (28.7\%) and 15 of 63 ART initiators (23.8\%) in the home and facility groups, respectively, were lost from ART (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.62-2.25, P = .57).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Malawian adults offered HIV self-testing, optional home initiation of care compared with standard HIV care resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of adults initiating ART.

	doi = {10.7448/IAS.17.1.18932},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that HIV-positive adults with CD4 count ≤500 cells/mm(3) initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART). In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, CD4 count is not widely available or consistently used and instead the WHO clinical staging system is used to determine ART eligibility. However, concerns have been raised regarding its discriminatory ability to identify patients eligible to start ART. We therefore reviewed the accuracy of WHO stage 3 or 4 assessment in identifying ART eligibility according to CD4 count thresholds for ART initiation.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Global Health databases and conference abstracts using a comprehensive strategy for studies that compared the results of WHO clinical staging with CD4 count thresholds. Studies performed in sub-Saharan Africa and published in English between 1998 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion according to our predefined study protocol. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were derived for each CD4 count threshold and hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 25,032 participants from 14 countries. Most studies assessed individuals attending ART clinics prior to treatment initiation. WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease had a sensitivity of 60\% (95\% CI: 45-73\%, Q=914.26, p{\textless}0.001) and specificity of 73\% (95\% CI: 60-83\%, Q=1439.43, p{\textless}0.001) for a CD4 threshold of ≤200 cells/mm(3) (11 studies); sensitivity and specificity for a threshold of CD4 count ≤350 cells/mm(3) were 45\% (95\% CI: 26-66\%, Q=1607.31, p{\textless}0.001) and 85\% (95\% CI: 69-93\%, Q=896.70, p{\textless}0.001), respectively (six studies). For the threshold of CD4 count ≤500 cells/mm(3) sensitivity was 14\% (95\% CI: 13-15\%) and specificity was 95\% (95\% CI: 94-96\%) (one study).
CONCLUSIONS: When used for individual treatment decisions, WHO clinical staging misses a high proportion of individuals who are ART eligible by CD4 count, with sensitivity falling as CD4 count criteria rises. Access to accurate, accessible, robust and affordable CD4 count testing methods will be a pressing need for as long as ART initiation decisions are based on criteria other than seropositivity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of loss to follow-up in smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients before treatment initiation and outcomes among patients who were traced.
METHODS: Ovid Medline and Global Health databases were searched for studies published between 1994 and January 2013 that described pre-treatment loss to follow-up in patients with smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis in routine national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) in low- and lower-middle-income countries and in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. Data on the proportion of patients who did not initiate treatment after their tuberculosis diagnosis were extracted from studies meeting inclusion criteria. Where available, data on causes and outcomes, including initiation of tuberculosis treatment at another facility, were investigated. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed and random-effects meta-analyses by subgroup (region) were performed.
FINDINGS: Twenty-three eligible studies were identified, with a total of 34 706 smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients from 14 countries (8 in Africa, 5 in Asia and 1 in the western Pacific). Most studies were retrospective and linked laboratory and treatment registers to identify pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Pre-treatment loss to follow-up varied from 4 to 38\% and was common in studies from Africa (random-effects weighted proportion, WP: 18\%; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 13-22) and Asia (WP: 13\%; 95\% CI: 10-15).
CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment loss to follow-up, common in most settings, can hinder tuberculosis control efforts. By not counting individuals who are lost to follow-up before treatment when reporting standard programme indicators, NTPs underestimate case detection rates and mortality and overestimate cure rates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impressive achievements have been made towards achieving universal coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the effects of rapid ART scale-up on delays between HIV diagnosis and treatment initiation have not been well described.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study covering eight years of ART initiators (2004-2011) was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi. The time between most recent positive HIV test and ART initiation was calculated and temporal trends in delay to initiation were described. Factors associated with time to initiation were investigated using multivariate regression analysis.
RESULTS: From 2004-2011, there were 15,949 ART initiations at QECH (56\% female; 8\% children [0-10 years] and 5\% adolescents [10-20 years]). Male initiators were likely to have more advanced HIV infection at initiation than female initiators (70\% vs. 64\% in WHO stage 3 or 4). Over the eight years studied, there were declines in treatment delay, with 2011 having the shortest delay at 36.5 days. On multivariate analysis CD4 count {\textless}50 cells/μl (adjusted geometric mean ratio [aGMR]: aGMR: 0.53, bias-corrected accelerated [BCA] 95\% CI: 0.42-0.68) was associated with shorter ART treatment delay. Women (aGMR: 1.12, BCA 95\% CI: 1.03-1.22) and patients diagnosed with HIV at another facility outside QECH (aGMR: 1.61, BCA 95\% CI: 1.47-1.77) had significantly longer treatment delay.
CONCLUSIONS: Continued improvements in treatment delays provide evidence that universal access to ART can be achieved using the public health approach adopted by Malawi However, the longer delays for women and patients diagnosed at outlying sites emphasises the need for targeted interventions to support equitable access for these groups.},

This study set out to validate a map book system for use in urban slums with no municipal address systems, where classification has been shown to be inaccurate when address descriptions were used. Between April and July 2011, 28 noncontiguous clusters were demarcated in Blantyre, Malawi. In December 2011, antiretroviral therapy initiators were asked to identify themselves as cluster residents (yes/no and which cluster) by using map books. A random sample of antiretroviral therapy initiators was used to validate map book categorization against Global Positioning System coordinates taken from participants' households. Of the 202 antiretroviral therapy initiators, 48 (23.8\%) were categorized with the map book system as in-cluster residents and 147 (72.8\%) as out-of-cluster residents, and 7 (3.4\%) were unsure. Agreement between map books and the Global Positioning System was 100\% in the 20 adults selected for validation and was 95.0\% (κ = 0.96, 95\% confidence interval: 0.84, 1.00) in an additional 20 in-cluster residents (overall κ = 0.97, 95\% confidence interval: 0.90, 1.00). With map books, cluster residents were classified rapidly and accurately. If validated elsewhere, this approach could be of widespread value in that it would enable accurate categorization without home visits.},

METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with health providers and HIV-positive primary care patients as part of a prospective cohort study at primary health centres in Blantyre, Malawi. Patients successful and unsuccessful in linking to ART were included.
RESULTS: Progression through the HIV care pathway was strongly influenced by socio-cultural norms, particularly around the perceived need to regain respect lost during a period of visibly declining health. Capacity to call upon the support of networks of families, friends and employers was a key determinant of successful progression. Over-busy clinics, non-functioning laboratories and unsuitable tools used for ART eligibility assessment (WHO clinical staging system and centralized CD4 count measurement) were important health systems determinants of drop-out.
CONCLUSIONS: Key interventions that could rapidly improve linkage include guarantee of same-day, same-clinic ART eligibility assessments; utilization of the support offered by peer-groups and community health workers; and integration of HTC and ART programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor rates of linkage from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation are a major barrier to universal coverage of ART in sub-Saharan Africa, with reasons for failure poorly understood. In the first study of this kind at primary care level, we investigated the pathway to care in the Malawian National Programme, one of the strongest in Africa.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective cohort study was undertaken at two primary care clinics in Blantyre, Malawi. Newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults ({\textgreater}15 years) were followed for 6-months to assess completion of eligibility assessments, initiation of ART and death. Two hundred and eighty participants were followed for 82.6 patient-years. ART eligibility assessments were problematic: only 134 (47.9\%) received same day WHO staging and 121 (53.2\%) completed assessments by 6-months. Completion of CD4 measurement (stage 1/2 only) was 81/153 (52.9\%). By 6-months, 87/280 (31.1\%) had initiated ART with higher uptake in participants who were ART eligible (68/91, 74.7\%), and among participants who received same-day staging (52/134 [38.8\%] vs. 35/146 [24.0\%] p = 0.007). Non-completion of ART eligibility assessments (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.11, 95\% CI: 0.06-0.21) was associated with failure to initiate ART. Retention in pre-ART care for non-ART initiators was low (55/193 [28.5\%]). Of the 15 (5.4\%) deaths, 11 (73.3\%) occurred after ART initiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although uptake of ART was high and prompt for patients with known eligibility, there was frequent failure to complete eligibility assessment and poor retention in pre-ART care. HIV care programmes should urgently evaluate the way patients are linked to ART. In particular, there is a critical need for simplified, same-day ART eligibility assessments, reduced requirements for hospital visits, and active defaulter follow-up.},

This study aimed at determining factors associated with delayed PTB diagnosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. Methods. A retrospective observational study was done using clinic records of HIV-infected PTB suspects attending an HIV/AIDS clinic at Tintswalo rural hospital in South Africa (SA) between January 2006 and December 2007. Using routine clinic registers, 480 records were identified. Results. PTB diagnosis delay was found among 77/176 (43.8\%) of the patients diagnosed with PTB. The mean delay of PTB diagnosis was 170.6 days; diagnosis delay ranged 1-30 days in 27 (35.1\%) patients, 31-180 days in 24 (33.8\%) patients; 24 (31.2\%) patients remained undiagnosed for ≥180 days. Independent factors associated with delayed diagnosis were: older age {\textgreater}40 years (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.43, 95\% CI 1.45-8.08) and virological failure (OR 2.72, 95\% CI 1.09-6.74). Conclusion. There is a considerable delayed PTB diagnosis among HIV-infected patients in rural SA. Older patients as well as patients with high viral load are at a higher risk of PTB diagnosis delay. Therefore efforts to reduce PTB diagnosis delay need to emphasised.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand reasons for suboptimal and delayed uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by describing the patterns of HIV testing and counselling (HTC) and outcomes of ART eligibility assessments in primary clinic attendees.
METHODS: All clinic attendances and episodes of HTC were recorded at two clinics in Blantyre. A cohort of newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults ({\textgreater}15 years) was recruited and exit interviews undertaken. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate factors associated with referral to start ART. Qualitative interviews were conducted with providers and patients.
RESULTS: There were 2398 episodes of HTC during 18,021 clinic attendances (13.3\%) between January and April 2011. The proportion of clinic attendees undergoing HTC was lowest in non-pregnant women (6.3\%) and men (8.5\%), compared with pregnant women (47.2\%). Men had more advanced HIV infection than women (79.7\% WHO stage 3 or 4 vs. 56.4\%). Problems with WHO staging and access to CD4 counts affected ART eligibility assessments; only 48\% completed ART eligibility assessment, and 54\% of those reporting WHO stage 3/4 illnesses were not referred to start ART promptly. On multivariate analysis, HIV-positive pregnant women were significantly less likely to be referred directly for ART initiation (adjusted OR: 0.29, 95\% CI: 0.13-0.63).
CONCLUSIONS: These data show that provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) has not yet been fully implemented at primary care clinics. Suboptimal ART eligibility assessments and referral (reflecting the difficulties of WHO staging in primary care) mean that simplified eligibility assessment tools are required to reduce unnecessary delay and attrition in the pre-ART period. Simplified initiation criteria for pregnant women, as being introduced in Malawi, should improve linkage to ART.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A substantial proportion of HIV-infected individuals in the UK are unaware of their status and late presentations continue, especially in low prevalence areas. Fourth generation antigen/antibody rapid test kits could facilitate earlier diagnosis of HIV in non-clinical settings but lack data on performance under programmatic conditions.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated the performance of Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo Test (Determine Combo), a rapid test with indicators for both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen, in participants recruited from community outreach and hospital-based sexual health clinics. HIV infection was confirmed using laboratory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA), Line Immuno Assay (LIA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In total, 953 people underwent HIV testing. HIV antibody (Ab) prevalence was 1.8\% (17/953). Four false positive rapid tests were identified: two antibody and two p24 antigen (Ag) reactions. Of participants diagnosed as HIV Ab positive, 2/17 (12\%) were recent seroconverters based on clinical history and HIV antibody avidity test results. However, none of these were detected by the p24 antigen component of the rapid test kit. There were no other true positive p24 Ag tests.
CONCLUSION: These data lend support to an increasing body of evidence suggesting that 4th generation rapid HIV tests have little additional benefit over 3rd generation HIV kits for routine screening in low prevalence settings and have high rates of false positives. In order to optimally combine community-based case-finding among hard-to-reach groups with reliable and early diagnosis 3rd generation kits should be primarily used with laboratory testing of individuals thought to be at risk of acute HIV infection. A more reliable point of care diagnostic is required for the accurate detection of acute HIV infection under programmatic conditions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV/AIDS related stigma is a major barrier to uptake of HIV testing and counselling (HTC). We assessed the extent of stigmatising attitudes expressed by participants offered community-based HTC, and their anticipated stigma from others to assess relationship with HIV test uptake. From these data, we constructed a brief stigma scale for use around the time of HIV testing.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult members of 60 households in urban Blantyre, Malawi, were selected using population-weighted random cluster sampling and offered HTC with the option to self-test before confirmatory HTC. Prior to HTC a 15-item HIV stigma questionnaire was administered. We used association testing and principal components analysis (PCA) to construct a scale measure of stigma. Of 226 adults invited to participate, 216 (95.6\%) completed questionnaires and 198/216 (91.7\%) opted to undergo HTC (all self-tested). Stigmatising attitudes were uncommon, but anticipated stigma was common, especially fearing verbal abuse (22\%) or being abandoned by their partner (11\%). Three questions showed little association or consistency with the remaining 12 stigma questions and were not included in the final scale. For the 12-question final scale, Cronbach's alpha was 0.75. Level of stigma was not associated with previously having tested for HIV (p = 0.318) or agreeing to HTC (p = 0.379), but was associated with expressed worry about being or becoming HIV infected (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Anticipated stigma prior to HTC was common among both men and women. However, the high uptake of HTC suggests that this did not translate into reluctance to accept community-based testing. We constructed a brief scale to measure stigma at the time of HIV testing that could rapidly identify individuals requiring additional support following diagnosis and monitor the impact of increasing availability of community-based HTC on prevalence of stigma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Liverpool, injecting drug users (IDUs), men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) and UK Africans experience a disproportionate burden of HIV, yet services do not reach out to these groups and late presentations continue. We set out to: increase testing uptake in targeted marginalized groups through a community and genitourinary medicine (GUM)-based point of care testing (POCT) programme; and conduct a process evaluation to examine service provider inputs and document service user perceptions of the programme.
METHODS: Mixed quantitative, qualitative and process evaluation methods were used. Service providers were trained to use fourth generation rapid antibody/antigen HIV tests. Existing outreach services incorporated POCT into routine practice. Clients completed a semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with service providers.
RESULTS: Between September 2009 and June 2010, 953 individuals underwent POCT (GUM: 556 [59\%]; community-based sites: 397 [42\%]). Participants in the community were more likely to be male (p = 0.028), older (p {\textless} 0.001), of UK African origin (p {\textless} 0.001) and IDUs (p {\textless} 0.001) than participants from the GUM clinic. Seventeen new HIV diagnoses were confirmed (prevalence = 1.8\%), 16 of whom were in risk exposure categories (prevalence: 16/517, 3.1\%). Questionnaires and FGDs showed that clients and service providers were supportive of POCT, highlighting benefits of reaching out to marginalised communities and incorporating HIV prevention messages.
CONCLUSIONS: Community and GUM clinic-based POCT for HIV was feasible and acceptable to clients and service providers in a low prevalence setting. It successfully reached target groups, many of whom would not have otherwise tested. We recommend POCT be considered among strategies to increase the uptake of HIV testing among groups who are currently underserved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cases of smear-negative TB have increased dramatically in high prevalence HIV settings and pose considerable diagnostic and management challenges.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between February 2006 and July 2007, a cohort study nested within a cluster-randomised trial of community-based case finding strategies for TB in Harare, Zimbabwe was undertaken. Participants who had negative sputum smears and remained symptomatic of TB were follow-up for one year with standardised investigations including HIV testing, repeat sputum smears, TB culture and chest radiography. Defaulters were actively traced to the community. The objectives were to investigate the incidence and risk factors for TB. TB was diagnosed in 218 (18.2\%) participants, of which 39.4\% was bacteriologically confirmed. Most cases (84.2\%) were diagnosed within 3 months, but TB incidence remained high thereafter (111.3 per 1000 person-years, 95\% CI: 86.6 to 146.3). HIV prevalence was 63.3\%, and HIV-infected individuals had a 3.5-fold higher risk of tuberculosis than HIV-negative individuals.
CONCLUSION: We found that diagnosis of TB was insensitive and slow, even with early radiography and culture. Until more sensitive and rapid diagnostic tests become widely available, a much more proactive and integrated approach towards prompt initiation of ART, ideally from within TB clinics and without waiting for TB to be excluded, is needed to minimise the risk and consequences of diagnostic delay.},

	abstract = {A retrospective cohort study of mortality rates and potential predictors of death was conducted in public-sector patients initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) between October 2005 and September 2007 in a rural, under-resourced region of South Africa. The aims were to determine the relative contribution of death to cohort exit and the causes and predictors of mortality among HAART initiators. A community outreach programme traced non-attenders. Patients categorised as dying at home underwent a verbal autopsy (by interviewing family members) and case-file review, and those dying in hospital a case-file review, to determine the probable cause of death. At 24 months 1131 (83.6\%) patients were retained on treatment in the programme, 124 (9.2\%) had died, 63 (4.7\%) had transferred out, and 35 (2.6\%) were lost to follow-up. The most common causes of death were tuberculosis (44.3\%) and diarrhoeal diseases (24.5\%). Death was the major reason for cohort exit. As experience is gained with rural HAART programmes mortality rates may decrease. These results draw attention to the need for early HIV diagnosis, increased access to HAART services with earlier treatment initiation, and routine screening and aggressive management of opportunistic infections, particularly tuberculosis.},

DESIGN: This was a cohort study of all TB cases from North West England diagnosed between 27 March 2012 and 28 June 2016. The social risk factors of TB cases were evaluated to estimate their need for enhanced case management (ECM), from 0 (standard of care) to 3 (intensive social support).
RESULTS: A total of 2139 cases and their 10 019 contacts met the eligibility criteria. Being a contact of a patient with smear-positive TB with high ECM or being of Black Caribbean ethnicity was independently associated with greater odds of active TB disease (smear-positive vs. smear-negative, OR 5.3, 95\%CI 3.2-8.7; ECM-3 vs. ECM-0, OR 2.2, 95\%CI 1.01-5.0; Black Caribbean vs. White, OR 7.4, 95\%CI 2.1-25). Being a contact of a patient with smear-positive TB or of Black Caribbean ethnicity was also independently associated with greater odds of tuberculous infection (smear-positive vs. smear-negative, OR 5.3, 95\%CI 3.8-7.3; and Black Caribbean vs. White, OR 6.7, 95\%CI 2.0-25).
CONCLUSIONS: The social complexity and ethnicity of patients were associated with tuberculous infection and TB disease in their contacts.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Scale-up of HIV self-testing (HIVST) will play a key role in meeting the United Nation's 90-90-90 targets. Delayed re-reading of used HIVST devices has been used by early implementation studies to validate the performance of self-test kits and to estimate HIV positivity among self-testers. We investigated the stability of results on used devices under controlled conditions to assess its potential as a quality assurance approach for HIVST scale-up. METHODS: 444 OraQuick((R)) HIV-1/2 rapid antibody tests were conducted using commercial plasma from two HIV-positive donors and HIV-negative plasma (high-reactive n = 148, weak-reactive n = 148 and non-reactive n = 148) and incubated them for six months under four conditions (combinations of high and low temperatures and humidity). Devices were re-read daily for one week, weekly for one subsequent month and then once a month by independent readers unaware of the  previous results. We used multistage transition models to investigate rates of change in device results, and between storage conditions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was a high incidence of device instability. Forty-three (29\%) of 148 initially non-reactive results became false weak-reactive results. These changes  were observed across all incubation conditions, the earliest on Day 4 (n = 9 kits). No initially HIV-reactive results changed to a non-reactive result. There  were no significant associations between storage conditions and hazard of results transition. We observed substantial statistical agreement between independent re-readers over time (agreement range: 0.74 to 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Delayed re-reading of used OraQuick((R)) HIV-1/2 rapid antibody tests is not currently a  valid methodological approach to quality assurance and monitoring as we observed  a high incidence (29\%) of true non-reactive tests changing to false weak-reactive and therefore its use may overestimate true HIV positivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Household contact tracing of index TB cases has been advocated as a key part of TB control for many years, but has not been widely implemented in many low-resource setting because of the current dearth of high quality evidence for effectiveness. Innovative strategies for earlier, more effective treatment are particularly important in contexts with hyper-endemic levels of HIV, where levels of TB infection remain extremely high.
METHODS: We present the design of a household cluster-randomised controlled trial of interventions aimed at improving TB-free survival and reducing childhood prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among household contacts of index TB cases diagnosed in two provinces of South Africa. Households of index TB cases will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an intensified home screening and linkage for TB and HIV intervention, or enhanced standard of care. The primary outcome will compare between groups the TB-free survival of household contacts over 15 months. All participants, or their next-of-kin, will provide written informed consent to participate.
DISCUSSION: Evidence from randomised trials is required to identify cost-effective approaches to TB case-finding that can be applied at scale in sub-Saharan Africa.

Triage tests are simple and low-cost tests aiming to improve ease of access and implementation (compared with confirmatory tests) and decrease the proportion of patients requiring more expensive confirmatory testing. Evaluation of triage tests should occur in settings of intended use, such as community and primary healthcare centers. Important considerations for triage test evaluation include study design, population, sample type, test throughput, use of thresholds, reference standard (ideally culture), and specimen flow.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Household contacts of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) often have latent TB infection, and are at risk of progression to disease. We set out to investigate whether index TB case HIV status was linked to a higher probability of latent TB infection among household contacts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from participants in the intervention arm of a household cluster-randomised trial in two South Africa provinces (Mangaung, Free State, and Capricorn, Limpopo). In intervention group households, TB contacts underwent HIV testing and tuberculin skin testing (TST). TST induration was estimated at two cut-offs (≥5mm, ≥10mm). Multilevel Bayesian regression models estimated posterior distributions of the percentage of household contacts with TST induration ≥5mm and ≥10mm by age group, and compared the odds of latent TB infection by key risk factors including HIV status index case age and study province.
RESULTS: A total of 2,985 household contacts of 924 index cases were assessed, with most 2,725 (91.3\%) undergoing TST. HIV prevalence in household contacts was 14\% and 10\% in Mangaung and Capricorn respectively. Overall, 16.8\% (458/2,725) had TST induration of ≥5mm and 13.1\% (359/2,725) ≥10mm. In Mangaung, children aged 0-4 years had a high TST positivity prevalence compared to their peers in Capricorn (22.0\% vs. 7.6\%, and 20.5\% vs. 2.3\%, using TST thresholds of ≥5mm and ≥10mm respectively). Compared to contacts from Capricorn, household contacts living in Mangaung were more likely to have TST induration ≥5mm (odds ratio [OR]: 3.08, 95\% credibility interval [CI]: 2.13-4.58) and ≥10mm (OR: 4.52, 95\% CI: 3.03-6.97). There was a 90\% and 92\% posterior probability that the odds of TST induration ≥5mm (OR: 0.79, 95\% CI: 0.56-1.14) and ≥10mm (OR: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.53-1.10) respectively were lower in household contacts of HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative index cases.
CONCLUSIONS: High TST induration positivity, especially among young children and people living in Mangaung indicates considerable TB transmission despite high antiretroviral therapy coverage. Household contact of HIV-positive index TB cases were less likely to have evidence of latent TB infection than contacts of HIV-negative index cases.},

	abstract = {Introduction Over 40\% of global tuberculosis case notifications are diagnosed clinically without mycobacteriological confirmation. Standard diagnostic algorithms include ‘trial-of-antibiotics’—empirical antibiotic treatment given to mycobacteriology-negative individuals to treat infectious causes of symptoms other than tuberculosis, as a ‘rule-out’ diagnostic test for tuberculosis. Potentially 26.5 million such antibiotic courses/year are prescribed globally for the 5.3 million/year mycobacteriology-negative patients, making trial-of-antibiotics the most common tuberculosis diagnostic, and a global-scale risk for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Our systematic review found no randomised controlled trial (RCT) to support use of trial-of-antibiotic. The RCT aims to determine the diagnostic and clinical value and AMR consequences of trial-of-antibiotics.
Methods and analysis A three-arm, open-label, RCT randomising (1:1:1) Malawian adults (≥18 years) seeking primary care for cough into: (a) azithromycin 500 mg one time per day for 3 days or (b) amoxicillin 1 g three times per day for 5 days or (c) standard-of-care (no immediate antibiotic). We will perform mycobacteriology tests (microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF (Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampicin) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture) at baseline. We will use audiocomputer-assisted self-interview to assess clinical improvement at day 8. First primary outcome will be proportion of patients reporting day 8 improvement out of those with negative mycobacteriology (specificity). Second primary outcome will be day 29 incidence of a composite endpoint of either death or hospitalisation or missed tuberculosis diagnosis. To determine AMR impact we compare proportion of resistant nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates on day 29. 400 mycobacteriology-negative participants/arm will be required to detect a ≥10\% absolute difference in diagnostic specificity with 80\% power. We will estimate measures of effect by comparing outcomes in antibiotic arms (combined and individually) to standard-of-care.
Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed and approved by Malawi College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee, London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Research Ethics Committee and Regional Committee for Health and Research Ethics – Norway, and Malawi Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board. We will present abstracts at relevant conferences, and prepare a manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-tuberculosis lung damage (PTLD) is a recognised consequence of pulmonary TB (pTB). However, little is known about its prevalence, patterns and associated outcomes, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and HIV-positive adults.
METHODS: Adult (≥15 years) survivors of a first episode of pTB in Blantyre, Malawi, completed the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, spirometry and high-resolution CT (HRCT) chest imaging at TB treatment completion. Symptom, spirometry, health seeking, TB-retreatment and mortality data were collected prospectively to 1 year. Risk factors for persistent symptoms, pulmonary function decline and respiratory-related health-seeking were identified through multivariable regression modelling.
RESULTS: Between February 2016 and April 2017, 405 participants were recruited. Median age was 35 years (IQR: 28 to 41), 77.3\% (313/405) had had microbiologically proven pTB, and 60.3\% (244/403) were HIV-positive. At pTB treatment completion, 60.7\% (246/405) reported respiratory symptoms, 34.2\% (125/365) had abnormal spirometry, 44.2\% (170/385) had bronchiectasis ≥1 lobe and 9.4\% (36/385) had ≥1 destroyed lobe on HRCT imaging. At 1 year, 30.7\% (113/368) reported respiratory symptoms, 19.3\% (59/305) and 14.1\% (43/305) of patients had experienced declines in FEV1 or FVC of ≥100 mL, 16.3\% (62/380) had reported ≥1 acute respiratory event and 12.2\% (45/368) had symptoms affecting their ability to work.
CONCLUSIONS: PTLD is a common and under-recognised consequence of pTB that is disabling for patients and associated with adverse outcomes beyond pTB treatment completion. Increased efforts to prevent PTLD and guidelines for management of established disease are urgently needed. Low-cost clinical interventions to improve patient outcomes must be evaluated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many southern African countries are nearing the global goal of diagnosing 90\% of people with HIV by 2020. In 2016, 84 and 86\% of people with HIV knew their status in Malawi and Zimbabwe, respectively. However, gaps remain, particularly among men. We investigated awareness and use of, and willingness to self-test for HIV and explored sociodemographic associations before large-scale implementation.
METHODS: We pooled responses from two of the first cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys to include HIV self-testing (HIVST) questions in Malawi and Zimbabwe in 2015-16. We investigated sociodemographic factors and sexual risk behaviours associated with previously testing for HIV, and past use, awareness of, and future willingness to self-test using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for the sample design and limiting analysis to participants with a completed questionnaire and valid HIV test result. We restricted analysis of willingness to self-test to Zimbabwean men, as women and Malawians were not systematically asked this question.
RESULTS: Of 31,385 individuals, 31.2\% of men had never tested compared with 16.5\% of women (p {\textless} 0.001). For men, the likelihood of having ever tested increased with age. Past use and awareness of HIVST was very low, 1.2 and 12.6\%, respectively. Awareness was lower among women than men (9.1\% vs 15.3\%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.55; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.75), and at younger ages, and lower education and literacy levels. Willingness to self-test among Zimbabwean men was high (84.5\%), with greater willingness associated with having previously tested for HIV, being at high sexual risk (highest willingness [aOR = 3.74; 95\%CI: 1.39-10.03, p {\textless} 0.009]), and being ≥25 years old. Wealthier men had greater awareness of HIVST than poorer men (p {\textless} 0.001). The highest willingness to self-test (aOR = 3.74; 95\%CI: 1.39-10.03, p {\textless} 0.009) was among men at high HIV-related sexual risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2015-16, many Malawian and Zimbabwean men had never tested for HIV. Despite low awareness and minimal HIVST experience, willingness to self-test was high among Zimbabwean men, especially older men with moderate-to-high HIV-related sexual risk. These data provide a valuable baseline against which to investigate population-level uptake of HIVST as programmes scale up. Programmes introducing, or planning to introduce, HIVST should consider including relevant questions in population-based surveys.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patients with tuberculosis (TB) symptoms have high prevalence of HIV, and should be prioritised for HIV testing.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort study in Bangwe primary care clinic, Blantyre, Malawi, all adults (18 years or older) presenting with an acute illness were screened for TB symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss). Demographic characteristics were linked to exit interview by fingerprint bioidentification. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the proportion completing same-visit HIV testing, comparing between those with and without TB symptoms.
RESULTS: There were 5427 adult attendees between 21/5/2018 and 6/9/2018. Exit interviews were performed for 2402 (44\%). 276 patients were excluded from the analysis, being already on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Presentation with any TB symptom was common for men (54.6\%) and women (57.4\%). Overall 27.6\% (585/ 2121) attenders reported being offered testing and 21.5\% (455/2121) completed provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) and received results. The proportions offered testing were similar among participants with and without TB symptoms (any TB symptom: 29.0\% vs. 25.7\%). This was consistent for each individual symptom; cough, weight loss, fever and night sweats. Multivariable regression models indicated men, younger adults and participants who had previously tested were more likely to complete PITC than women, older adults and those who had never previously tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Same-visit completion of HIV testing was suboptimal, especially among groups known to have high prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. As countries approach universal coverage of ART, identifying and prioritising currently underserved groups for HIV testing will be essential.},

	abstract = {Background
              The prevalence of diseases other than TB detected during chest X-ray (CXR) screening is unknown in sub-Saharan Africa. This represents a missed opportunity for identification and treatment of potentially significant disease. Our aim was to describe and quantify non-TB abnormalities identified by TB-focused CXR screening during the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey.
            
            
              Methods
              We reviewed a random sample of 1140 adult (≥15 years) CXRs classified as ‘abnormal, suggestive of TB’ or ‘abnormal other’ during field interpretation from the TB prevalence survey. Each image was read (blinded to field classification and study radiologist read) by two expert radiologists, with images classified into one of four major anatomical categories and primary radiological findings. A third reader resolved discrepancies. Prevalence and 95\% CIs of abnormalities diagnosis were estimated.
            
            
              Findings
              Cardiomegaly was the most common non-TB abnormality at 259 out of 1123 (23.1\%, 95\% CI 20.6\% to 25.6\%), while cardiomegaly with features of cardiac failure occurred in 17 out of 1123 (1.5\%, 95\% CI 0.9\% to 2.4\%). We also identified chronic pulmonary pathology including suspected COPD in 3.2\% (95\% CI 2.3\% to 4.4\%) and non-specific patterns in 4.6\% (95\% CI 3.5\% to 6.0\%). Prevalence of active-TB and severe post-TB lung changes was 3.6\% (95\% CI 2.6\% to 4.8\%) and 1.4\% (95\% CI 0.8\% to 2.3\%), respectively.
            
            
              Interpretation
              Based on radiological findings, we identified a wide variety of non-TB abnormalities during population-based TB screening. TB prevalence surveys and active case finding activities using mass CXR offer an opportunity to integrate disease screening efforts.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) control relies on early diagnosis and treatment. International guidelines recommend systematic TB screening at health facilities, but implementation is challenging. We investigated completion of recommended TB screening steps in Blantyre, Malawi.
METHODS: A prospective cohort recruited adult outpatients attending Bangwe primary clinic. Entry interviews were linked to exit interviews. The proportion of participants progressing through each step of the diagnostic pathway were estimated. Factors associated with request for sputum were investigated using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 5442 clinic attendances 2397 (44\%) had exit interviews. In clinically indicated participants (n = 445) 256 (57.5\%) were asked about cough, 36 (8.1\%) were asked for sputum, 21 (4.7\%) gave sputum and 1 (0.2\%) received same-day results. Significant associations with request for sputum were: any TB symptom (aOR:3.20, 95\%CI:2.02-5.06), increasing age (aOR:1.02, 95\%CI:1.01-1.04 per year) and for HIV-negative participants only, a history of previous TB (aOR:3.37, 95\%CI:1.45-7.81). Numbers requiring sputum tests (26/day) outnumbered diagnostic capacity (8-12/day).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients were lost at every stage of the TB care cascade, with same day sputum submission following all steps of the diagnosis cascade achieved in only 4.7\% if clinically indicated. Infection control strategies should be implemented, with reporting on early steps of the TB care cascade formalised. High-throughput screening interventions, such as digital CXR, that can achieve same-day TB diagnosis are urgently needed to meet WHO End TB goals.},

	abstract = {Seasonal trends in tuberculosis (TB) notifications have been observed in several countries but are poorly understood. Explanatory factors may include weather, indoor crowding, seasonal respiratory infections and migration. Using enhanced citywide TB surveillance data collected over nine years in Blantyre, Malawi, we set out to investigate how weather and seasonality affect temporal trends in TB case notification rates (CNRs) across different demographic groups. We used data from prospective enhanced surveillance between April 2011 and December 2018, which systematically collected age, HIV status, sex and case notification dates for all registering TB cases in Blantyre. We retrieved temperature and rainfall data from the Global Surface Summary of the Day weather station database. We calculated weekly trends in TB CNRs, rainfall and temperature, and calculated 10-week moving averages. To investigate the associations between rainfall, temperature and TB CNRs, we fitted generalized linear models using a distributed lag nonlinear framework. The estimated Blantyre population increased from 1,068,151 in April 2011 to 1,264,304 in December 2018, with 15,908 TB cases recorded. Overall annual TB CNRs declined from 222 to 145 per 100,000 between 2012 and 2018, with the largest declines seen in HIV-positive people and adults aged over 20 years old. TB CNRs peaks occurred with increasing temperature in September and October before the onset of increased rainfall, and later in the rainy season during January-March, after sustained rainfall. When lag between a change in weather and TB case notifications was accounted for, higher average rainfall was associated with an equivalent six weeks of relatively lower TB notification rates, whereas there were no changes in TB CNR associated with change in average temperatures. TB CNRs in Blantyre have a seasonal pattern of two cyclical peaks per year, coinciding with the start and end of the rainy season. These trends may be explained by increased transmission at certain times of the year, by limited healthcare access, by patterns of seasonal respiratory infections precipitating cough and care-seeking, or by migratory patterns related to planting and harvesting during the rainy season.},

Mathematical models to forecast the long-term effects of ACF require empirical measurements of the yield, timing and costs of case detection. Pragmatic trials offer an opportunity to assess the cost-effectiveness of ACF interventions within a ‘real-world´ context. However, such
analyses generally require early introduction of economic evaluations to enable prospective data collection on resource requirements. Closing the global case-detection gap will require substantial additional resources, including continued investment in innovative technologies. Research is
essential to the optimal implementation, cost-effectiveness, and affordability of ACF in high-burden settings. To assess the value of ACF, we must prioritize the collection of high-quality data regarding costs and effectiveness, and link those data to analytical models that are adapted to

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reduces bone mineral density, mineralisation and turnover, and may impair fracture healing.
SETTING: This prospective cohort study in South Africa investigated whether HIV infection was associated with impaired fracture healing following trauma.
METHODS: All adults with acute tibia and femur fractures who underwent intermedullary nailing (IM) for fracture fixation between September 2017 and December 2018, at two tertiary hospitals, were followed for a minimum of 12 months post-operatively. The primary outcome was delayed bone union at 6 months (defined by the radiological union scoring system for the tibia [RUST] score {\textless}9), and the secondary outcome was non-union (defined as RUST score {\textless}9) at 9 months. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to investigate associations between HIV status and impaired fracture healing.
RESULTS: In total, 358 participants, who underwent 395 IM nailings, were enrolled in the study and followed up for 12 months. Seventy-one participants (71/358, 19·8\%) were HIV positive (83 IM nailings [83/395], 21.0\%). HIV was not associated with delayed fracture healing after IM nailing of the tibia or femur (multivariable odds ratio [OR]: 1·06; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0·50-2·22). Participants with HIV had a statistically significant lower odds of non-union compared to HIV-negative participants (multivariable OR: 0·17; 95\% CI: 0·01-0·92).
CONCLUSIONS: Fractures sustained in HIV-positive individuals can undergo surgical fixation as effectively as those in individuals who are HIV negative, with no increased risk of delayed union or non-union.},

              Patients with tuberculosis (TB) symptoms in low-resource settings face convoluted diagnostic and treatment linkage pathways, incurring substantial health-seeking costs. In the context of a randomised trial looking at the impact of novel diagnostics such as computer-aided chest x-ray diagnosis (CAD4TB), we aimed to investigate the costs incurred by patients seeking TB diagnosis and whether optimised diagnostic interventions could result in a reduction in the cost faced by households.
            
            
              
                Methods:
              
              PROSPECT was a three-arm randomised trial conducted in a public primary health clinic in Blantyre, Malawi during 2018-2019 (trial arms: standard of care [SOC]; HIV testing [HIV]; HIV testing and CAD4TB [HIV/TB]). The direct and indirect costs incurred by 219 PROSPECT participants over the 56-day follow-up period were collected. Costs were deemed catastrophic if they exceeded 20\% of annual household income. We compared mean costs and used generalised linear regression models to examine whether the interventions could result in a reduction in total costs.
            
            
              
                Results:
              
              
              The mean total cost incurred by all 219 participants was US\$12.11 (standard error (SE): 1.86). The indirect and direct cost was US\$8.47 (SE: 1.66) and US\$3.64 (SE: 0.38), respectively. The mean total cost composed of 5.6\% of the average annual household income. In total, 5\% (9/180) of the participants with complete income data incurred catastrophic costs. Compared to SOC, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean total cost faced by those in the HIV (ratio: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.51, 1.19) and HIV/TB arms (ratio: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.53, 1.37).
            
            
              
                Conclusions:
              
              
              Despite the absence of user fees, patients seeking healthcare with TB symptoms incurred catastrophic costs. The optimised TB diagnostic interventions that were investigated in the PROSPECT study did not significantly reduce costs. TB diagnosis interventions should be implemented alongside social protection policies whilst ensuring healthcare facilities are accessible by the poor.},

Fear of COVID-19 infection, temporary facility closures, inadequate personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 stigma because of similar symptoms to TB were mentioned as reasons for fewer people being diagnosed with TB. Public health measures could benefit control of both TB and COVID-19, but only if TB diagnostic services remain accessible and are considered safe to attend.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate trends in population incidence of HIV positive hospital admission and risk of in-hospital death among adults living with HIV between 2012 and 2019 in Blantyre, Malawi.
DESIGN: Population cohort study using an existing electronic health information system ('SPINE') at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital and Blantyre census data.
METHODS: We used multiple imputation and negative binomial regression to estimate population age- and sex-specific admission rates over time. We used a log-binomial model to investigate trends in risk of in-hospital death.
RESULTS: Of 32,814 adult medical admissions during Q4.2012-Q3.2019, HIV status was recorded for 75.6\%. HIV-positive admissions decreased substantially between 2012 and 2019. After imputation for missing data, HIV positive admissions were highest in Q3.2013 (173 per 100,000 adult Blantyre residents) and lowest in Q3.2019 (53 per 100,000 residents). An estimated 10,818 fewer than expected people living with HIV (PLHIV) (95\%CI 10,068-11,568) were admitted during 2012-2019 compared to the counterfactual situation where admission rates stayed the same throughout this period. Absolute reductions were greatest for women aged 25-34 years (2,264 fewer HIV-positive admissions, 95\%CI 2,002-2,526). In-hospital mortality for PLHIV was 23.5\%, with no significant change over time in any age-sex group, and no association with ART use at admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Rates of admission for adult PLHIV decreased substantially, likely due to large increases in community provision of HIV diagnosis, treatment and care. However, HIV-positive in-hospital deaths remain unacceptably high, despite improvements in ART coverage. A concerted research and implementation agenda is urgently needed to reduce inpatient deaths among PLHIV.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Injuries cause 30\% more deaths than HIV, TB and malaria combined, and a prospective fracture care registry was established to investigate the fracture burden and treatment in Malawi to inform evidence-based improvements.
OBJECTIVE: To use the analysis of prospectively-collected fracture data to develop evidence-based strategies to improve fracture care in Malawi and other similar settings.
DESIGN: Multicentre prospective registry study.
SETTING: Two large referral centres and two district hospitals in Malawi.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients with a fracture (confirmed by radiographs)-including patients with multiple fractures-were eligible to be included in the registry.
EXPOSURE: All fractures that presented to two urban central and two rural district hospitals in Malawi over a 3.5-year period (September 2016 to March 2020).
MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Demographics, characteristics of injuries, and treatment outcomes were collected on all eligible participants.
RESULTS: Between September 2016 and March 2020, 23,734 patients were enrolled with a median age of 15 years (interquartile range: 10-35 years); 68.7\% were male. The most common injuries were radius/ulna fractures (n = 8,682, 36.8\%), tibia/fibula fractures (n = 4,036, 17.0\%), humerus fractures (n = 3,527, 14.9\%) and femoral fractures (n = 2,355, 9.9\%). The majority of fractures (n = 21,729, 91.6\%) were treated by orthopaedic clinical officers; 88\% (20,885/2,849) of fractures were treated non-operatively, and 62.7\% were treated and sent home on the same day. Open fractures (OR:53.19, CI:39.68-72.09), distal femoral fractures (OR:2.59, CI:1.78-3.78), patella (OR:10.31, CI:7.04-15.07), supracondylar humeral fractures (OR:3.10, CI:2.38-4.05), ankle fractures (OR:2.97, CI:2.26-3.92) and tibial plateau fractures (OR:2.08, CI:1.47-2.95) were more likely to be treated operatively compared to distal radius fractures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The current model of fracture care in Malawi is such that trained orthopaedic surgeons manage fractures operatively in urban referral centres whereas orthopaedic clinical officers mainly manage fractures non-operatively in both district and referral centres. We recommend that orthopaedic surgeons should supervise orthopaedic clinical officers to manage non operative injuries in central and district hospitals. There is need for further studies to assess the clinical and patient reported outcomes of these fracture cases, managed both operatively and non-operatively.},

	doi = {10.1111/tmi.13658},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diseases other than tuberculosis (TB) detected during chest X-ray screening is poorly described in sub-Saharan Africa. Computer-assisted digital chest X-ray technology is available for TB screening and has the potential to be a screening tool for non-communicable diseases as well. Low- and middle-income countries are in a transition period where the burden of non-communicable diseases is increasing, but health systems are mainly focused on addressing infectious diseases.
METHODS: Participants were adults undergoing computer-assisted chest X-ray screening for tuberculosis in a community-wide tuberculosis prevalence survey in Blantyre, Malawi. Adults with abnormal radiographs by field radiographer interpretation were evaluated by a physician in a community-based clinic. X-ray classifications were compared to classifications of a random sample of normal chest X-rays by radiographer interpretation. Radiographic features were classified using WHO Integrated Management for Adult Illnesses (IMAI) guidelines. All radiographs taken at the screening tent were analysed by the Qure.ai qXR v2.0 software.
RESULTS: 5\% (648/13,490) of adults who underwent chest radiography were identified to have an abnormal chest X-ray by the radiographer. 387 (59.7\%) of the participants attended the X-ray clinic, and another 387 randomly sampled normal X-rays were available for comparison. Participants who were referred to the community clinic had a significantly higher HIV prevalence than those who had been identified to have a normal CXR by the field radiographer (90 [23.3\%] vs. 43 [11.1\%] p-value {\textless} 0.001). The commonest radiographic finding was cardiomegaly (20.7\%, 95\% CI 18.0-23.7). One in five (81/387) chest X-rays were misclassified by the radiographer. The overall mean Qure.ai qXR v2.0 score for all reviewed X-rays was 0.23 (SD 0.20). There was a high concordance of cardiomegaly classification between the physician and the computer-assisted software (109/118, 92.4\%).
CONCLUSION: There is a high burden of cardiomegaly on a chest X-ray at a community level, much of which is in patients with diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Cardiomegaly on chest X-ray may be a potential tool for screening for cardiovascular NCDs at the primary care level as well as in the community.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV and tuberculosis are frequently diagnosed concurrently. In March 2021, World Health Organization recommended that antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started within two weeks of tuberculosis treatment start, at any CD4 count. We assessed whether earlier ART improved outcomes in people with newly diagnosed HIV and tuberculosis.
METHODS: We did a systematic review by searching nine databases for trials that compared earlier ART to later ART initiation in people with HIV and tuberculosis. We included studies published from database inception to 12 March 2021. We compared ART within four weeks versus ART more than four weeks after TB treatment, and ART within two weeks versus ART between two and eight weeks, and stratified analysis by CD4 count. The main outcome was death; secondary outcomes included IRIS and AIDS-defining events. We pooled effect estimates using random effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We screened 2468 abstracts, and identified nine trials. Among people with all CD4 counts, there was no difference in mortality by earlier ART (≤4 week) versus later ART ({\textgreater}4 week) (risk difference [RD] 0\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -2\% to +1\%). Among people with CD4 count ≤50 cells/mm3 , earlier ART (≤4 weeks) reduced risk of death (RD -6\%, -10\% to -1\%). Among people with all CD4 counts earlier ART (≤4 weeks) increased the risk of IRIS (RD +6\%, 95\% CI +2\% to +10\%) and reduced the incidence of AIDS-defining events (RD -2\%, 95\% CI -4\% to 0\%). Results were similar when trials were restricted to the four trials which permitted comparison of ART within two weeks to ART between two and eight weeks. Trials were conducted between 2004 and 2014, before recommendations to treat HIV at any CD4 count or to rapidly start ART in people without TB. No trials included children or pregnant women. No trials included integrase inhibitors in ART regimens.
DISCUSSION: Earlier ART did not alter risk of death overall among people living with HIV who had TB disease. For logistical and patient preference reasons, earlier ART initiation for everyone with TB and HIV may be preferred to later ART.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As infectious diseases approach global elimination targets, spatial targeting is increasingly important to identify community hotspots of transmission and effectively target interventions. We aimed to synthesise relevant evidence to define best practice approaches and identify policy and research gaps.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically appraise evidence for the effectiveness of spatially targeted community public health interventions for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), leprosy and malaria.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, Web of Science and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between 1 January 1993 and 22 March 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: The studies had to include HIV or TB or leprosy or malaria and spatial hotspot definition, and community interventions.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A data extraction tool was used. For each study, we summarised approaches to identifying hotpots, intervention design and effectiveness of the intervention.
RESULTS: Ten studies, including one cluster randomised trial and nine with alternative designs (before-after, comparator area), satisfied our inclusion criteria. Spatially targeted interventions for HIV (one USA study), TB (three USA) and leprosy (two Brazil, one Federated States of Micronesia) each used household location and disease density to define hotspots followed by community-based screening. Malaria studies (one each from India, Indonesia and Kenya) used household location and disease density for hotspot identification followed by complex interventions typically combining community screening, larviciding of stagnant water bodies, indoor residual spraying and mass drug administration. Evidence of effect was mixed.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies investigating spatially targeted interventions were few in number, and mostly underpowered or otherwise limited methodologically, affecting interpretation of intervention impact. Applying advanced epidemiological methodologies supporting more robust hotspot identification and larger or more intensive interventions would strengthen the evidence-base for this increasingly important approach.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Men have a higher prevalence of undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) than women and can spend up to a year longer contributing to ongoing transmission in the community before receiving treatment. Health outcomes are often worse for patients with TB living in informal settlements especially men. This study aimed to understand the barriers preventing men from seeking care for TB and cocreate interventions to address these barriers.
METHODS: We used qualitative research methods including in-depth interviews and participatory workshops. Researchers worked with women and men living in Bangwe, an informal settlement in Blantyre, Malawi to develop interventions that reflected their lived realities. The study took place over two phases, in the first phase we undertook interviews with men and women to explore barrier to care seeking, in the second phase we used participatory workshops to cocreate interventions to address barriers and followed up on issues emerging from the workshops with further interviews. In total, 30 interviews were conducted, and 23 participants joined participatory workshops. The team used a thematic analysis to analyse the data.
RESULTS: Three interconnected thematic areas shaped men's health TB seeking behaviour: precarious socioeconomic conditions; gendered social norms; and constraints in the health system. Insecurity of day labour with no provision for sick leave; pressure to provide for the household and a gendered desire not to appear weak and a severely under-resourced health system all contributed to men delaying care in this context. Identified interventions included improved patient-provider relations within the health-system, improved workers' health rights and broader social support for households.
CONCLUSION: Improving mens' pathways to care requires interventions that consider contextual issues by addressing individual level socioeconomic factors but also broader structural factors of gendered social dynamics and health systems environment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suboptimal tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics and HIV contribute to the high global burden of TB. We investigated costs and yield from systematic HIV-TB screening, including computer-aided digital chest X-ray (DCXR-CAD).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this open, three-arm randomised trial, adults (≥18 years) with cough attending acute primary services in Malawi were randomised (1:1:1) to standard of care (SOC); oral HIV testing (HIV screening) and linkage to care; or HIV testing and linkage to care plus DCXR-CAD with sputum Xpert for high CAD4TBv5 scores (HIV-TB screening). Participants and study staff were not blinded to intervention allocation, but investigator blinding was maintained until final analysis. The primary outcome was time to TB treatment. Secondary outcomes included proportion with same-day TB treatment; prevalence of undiagnosed/untreated bacteriologically confirmed TB on day 56; and undiagnosed/untreated HIV. Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Cost-effectiveness analysis used a health-provider perspective. Between 15 November 2018 and 27 November 2019, 8,236 were screened for eligibility, with 473, 492, and 497 randomly allocated to SOC, HIV, and HIV-TB screening arms; 53 (11\%), 52 (9\%), and 47 (9\%) were lost to follow-up, respectively. At 56 days, TB treatment had been started in 5 (1.1\%) SOC, 8 (1.6\%) HIV screening, and 15 (3.0\%) HIV-TB screening participants. Median (IQR) time to TB treatment was 11 (6.5 to 38), 6 (1 to 22), and 1 (0 to 3) days (hazard ratio for HIV-TB versus SOC: 2.86, 1.04 to 7.87), with same-day treatment of 0/5 (0\%) SOC, 1/8 (12.5\%) HIV, and 6/15 (40.0\%) HIV-TB screening arm TB patients (p = 0.03). At day 56, 2 SOC (0.5\%), 4 HIV (1.0\%), and 2 HIV-TB (0.5\%) participants had undiagnosed microbiologically confirmed TB. HIV screening reduced the proportion with undiagnosed or untreated HIV from 10 (2.7\%) in the SOC arm to 2 (0.5\%) in the HIV screening arm (risk ratio [RR]: 0.18, 0.04 to 0.83), and 1 (0.2\%) in the HIV-TB screening arm (RR: 0.09, 0.01 to 0.71). Incremental costs were US\$3.58 and US\$19.92 per participant screened for HIV and HIV-TB; the probability of cost-effectiveness at a US\$1,200/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold was 83.9\% and 0\%. Main limitations were the lower than anticipated prevalence of TB and short participant follow-up period; cost and quality of life benefits of this screening approach may accrue over a longer time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: DCXR-CAD with universal HIV screening significantly increased the timeliness and completeness of HIV and TB diagnosis. If implemented at scale, this has potential to rapidly and efficiently improve TB and HIV diagnosis and treatment.

	abstract = {Background: Human-to-animal transmission of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is reported in South Africa but there is a paucity of epidemiological data. The aim of this One Health manuscript is to describe zooanthroponotic exposure of domestic animals to TB patients, virtually all of whom had laboratory confirmed pulmonary Mtb disease.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was nested within two TB contact tracing studies and collected data from 2017 to 2019. TB index patients and their households in three provinces of South Africa were recruited. A questionnaire was administered to households, assessing type and number of animals owned, degree of exposure of animals to humans, and veterinary consultations. For this analysis, we compared descriptive variables by animal-keeping status (animal-keeping vs non-animal keeping households), calculated the chi square and respective p-values.
Results: We visited 1766 households with at least one confirmed case of TB, 33\% (587/1766) had livestock or companion animals. Of non-animal-owning households, 2\% (27/1161) cared for other community members' livestock. Few (16\%, 92/587) households kept animals in their dwelling overnight, while 45\% (266/587) kept animals outside the home, but within 10 m of where people slept and ate. Most (81\%, 478/587) of people in animal-owning households were willing for their animal/s to have a TB skin test, but {\textless}1\% (5/587) of animals had been skin-tested; 4\% (24/587) of animal-owning households had a veterinary consultation in the past six months, and 5\% (31/587) reported one of their animals dying from natural causes in the prior six months.
Conclusion: Our survey suggests that a high proportion of patients with TB live in settings facilitating close contact with domestic animal species with known susceptibility to Mtb. There is a substantial exposure of household animals to patients with TB and therefore risk of both transmission to, and spillback from animals to humans.},

The risks and benefits of same-day ART initiation in PLHIV with tuberculosis symptoms are unknown. Methods We systematically reviewed nine databases on 12 March 2020 to identify studies that investigated same-day ART initiation among PLHIV with tuberculosis symptoms and reported both their approach to TB screening and clinical outcomes. We extracted and summarized data about TB screening, numbers of people starting same-day ART and outcomes. Results We included four studies. Two studies deferred ART for everyone with any tuberculosis symptoms (one or more of cough, fever, night sweats or weight loss) and substantial numbers of people had deferred ART start (28\% and 39\% did not start same-day ART). Two studies permitted some people with tuberculosis symptoms to start same-day ART, and fewer people deferred ART (2\% and 16\% did not start same-day). Two of the four studies were conducted sequentially; proven viral load suppression at 8 months was 31\% when everyone with tuberculosis symptoms had ART deferred, and 44\% when the algorithm was changed so that some people with tuberculosis symptoms could start same-day ART. Conclusions Although tuberculosis symptoms are very common in people starting ART, there is insufficient evidence about whether presence of tuberculosis symptoms should lead to ART start being deferred or not. Research to inform clear guidelines would help to maximise the benefits of same-day ART.},

We constructed Bayesian multi-level logistic regression models to investigate associations between distance and case fatality. A total of 479/4397 (10.9\%) TB patients died. Greater distance was associated with higher (odds ratio (OR) 1.07 per kilometre (km) increase, 95\% credible interval (CI) 0.99–1.16) odds of death in TB patients registered at the referral hospital, but not among TB patients registered at primary clinics (OR 0.98 per km increase, 95\% CI 0.92–1.03). Age (OR 1.02 per year increase, 95\% CI 1.01–1.02) and HIV-positive status (OR 2.21, 95\% CI 1.73–2.85) were also associated with higher odds of death. Model estimates were similar for both distance measures. Distance was a risk factor for death among patients at the main referral hospital, likely due to delayed diagnosis and suboptimal healthcare access. To reduce mortality, targeted community TB screening interventions for TB disease and HIV, and expansion of novel sensitive diagnostic tests are required.},

	abstract = {Background
To determine if tuberculosis (TB) screening improves patient outcomes, we conducted two systematic reviews to investigate the effect of TB screening on diagnosis, treatment outcomes, deaths (clinical review assessing 23 outcome indicators); and patient costs (economic review).
Methods
Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library were searched between 1/1/1980-13/4/2020 (clinical review) and 1/1/2010-14/8/2020 (economic review). As studies were heterogeneous, data synthesis was narrative.
Findings
Clinical review: of 27,270 articles, 18 (n=3 trials) were eligible. Nine involved general populations. Compared to passive case finding (PCF), studies showed lower smear grade (n=2/3) and time to diagnosis (n=2/3); higher pre-treatment losses to follow-up (screened 23\% and 29\% vs PCF 15\% and 14\%; n=2/2); and similar treatment success (range 68-81\%; n=4) and case fatality (range 3-11\%; n=5) in the screened group. Nine reported on risk groups. Compared to PCF, studies showed lower smear positivity among those culture-confirmed (n=3/4) and time to diagnosis (n=2/2); and similar (range 80-90\%; n=2/2) treatment success in the screened group. Case fatality was lower in n=2/3 observational studies; both reported on established screening programmes. A neonatal trial and post-hoc analysis of a household contacts trial found screening was associated with lower all-cause mortality. Economic review: From 2841 articles, six observational studies were eligible. Total costs (n=6) and catastrophic cost prevalence (n=4; range screened 9-45\% vs PCF 12-61\%) was lower among those screened.
Interpretation
We found very limited patient outcome data. Collecting and reporting this data must be prioritised to inform policy and practice.

	abstract = {Background: Community–based screening for tuberculosis (TB) could improve detection but is resource intensive. We set out to evaluate the accuracy of computer–aided TB screening using digital chest X-ray (CXR) to determine if this approach met target product profiles (TPP) for community–based screening. Methods: CXR images from participants in the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey were evaluated using CAD4TBv6 (Delft Imaging), giving a probabilistic score for pulmonary TB ranging from 0 (low probability) to 99 (high probability). We constructed a Bayesian latent class model to estimate the accuracy of CAD4TBv6 screening compared to bacteriologically–confirmed TB across CAD4TBv6 threshold cut–offs, incorporating data on Clinical Officer CXR interpretation, participant demographics (age, sex, TB symptoms, previous TB history), and sputum results. We compared model–estimated sensitivity and specificity of CAD4TBv6 to optimum and minimum TPPs. Results: Of 63,050 prevalence survey participants, 61,848 (98\%) had analysable CXR images, and 8,966 (14.5\%) underwent sputum bacteriological testing; 298 had bacteriologically–confirmed pulmonary TB. Median CAD4TBv6 scores for participants with bacteriologically–confirmed TB were significantly higher (72, IQR: 58–82.75) compared to participants with bacteriologically–negative sputum results (49, IQR: 44–57, p{\textless}0.0001). CAD4TBv6 met the optimum TPP; with the threshold set to achieve a mean sensitivity of 95\% (optimum TPP), specificity was 83.3\%, (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 83.0\%–83.7\%, CAD4TBv6 threshold: 55). There was considerable variation in accuracy by participant characteristics, with older individuals and those with previous TB having lowest specificity. Conclusions: CAD4TBv6 met the optimal TPP for TB community screening. To optimise screening accuracy and efficiency of confirmatory sputum testing, we recommend that an adaptive approach to threshold setting is adopted based on participant characteristics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ratios of bacteriologically positive tuberculosis (TB) prevalence to notification rates are used to characterise typical durations of TB disease. However, this ignores the clinical spectrum of tuberculosis disease and potentially long infectious periods with minimal or no symptoms prior to care-seeking.
METHODS: We developed novel statistical models to estimate progression from initial bacteriological positivity including smear conversion, symptom onset and initial care-seeking. Case-detection ratios, TB incidence, durations, and other parameters were estimated by fitting the model to tuberculosis prevalence survey and notification data (one subnational and 11 national datasets) within a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
RESULTS: Analysis across 11 national datasets found asymptomatic tuberculosis durations in the range 4-8 months for African countries; three countries in Asia (Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Philippines) showed longer durations of {\textgreater} 1 year. For the six countries with relevant data, care-seeking typically began half-way between symptom onset and notification. For Kenya and Blantyre, Malawi, individual-level data were available. The sex-specific durations of asymptomatic bacteriologically-positive tuberculosis were 9.0 months (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 7.2-11.2) for men and 8.1 months (95\% CrI: 6.2-10.3) for women in Kenya, and 4.9 months (95\% CrI: 2.6-7.9) for men and 3.5 months (95\% CrI: 1.3-6.2) for women in Blantyre. Age-stratified analysis of data for Kenya showed no strong age-dependence in durations. For Blantyre, HIV-stratified analysis estimated an asymptomatic duration of 1.3 months (95\% CrI: 0.3-3.0) for HIV-positive people, shorter than the 8.5 months (95\% CrI: 5.0-12.7) for HIV-negative people. Additionally, case-detection ratios were higher for people living with HIV than HIV-negative people (93\% vs 71\%).
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic TB disease typically lasts around 6 months. We found no evidence of age-dependence, but much shorter durations among people living with HIV, and longer durations in some Asian settings. To eradicate TB transmission, greater gains may be achieved by proactively screening people without symptoms through active case finding interventions.},

We hypothesised that self-taken samples are non-inferior for use with RDTs and in clinical and research settings could have substantial individual and public health benefit. Design A prospective diagnostic accuracy evaluation as part of the Facilitating Accelerated Clinical Evaluation of Novel Diagnostic Tests for COVID -19 (FALCON C-19), workstream C (undifferentiated community testing). Setting NHS Test and Trace drive-through community PCR testing site (Liverpool, UK). Participants Eligible participants 18 years or older with symptoms of COVID-19. 250 participants recruited; one withdrew before analysis. Sampling Self-administered throat/nasal swab for the Covios RDT, a trained HCW taken throat/nasal sample for PCR and HCW comparison throat/nasal swab for RDT. Main outcome measures Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were calculated; comparisons between self-taken and HCW-taken samples used McNemars test. Results Seventy-five participants (75/249, 30.1\%) were positive by RT-PCR. RDTs with self-taken swabs had a sensitivity of 90.5\% (67/74, 95\% CI: 83.9-97.2), compared to 78.4\% (58/74, 95\% CI: 69.0-87.8) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 12.2\%, 95\% CI: 4.7-19.6, p=0.003). Specificity for self-taken swabs was 99.4\% (173/174, 95\% CI: 98.3-100.0), versus 98.9\% (172/174, 95\% CI: 97.3-100.0) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 0.6\%, 95\% CI: 0.5-1.7, p=0.317). The PPV of self-taken RDTs (98.5\%, 67/68, 95\% CI: 95.7-100.0) and HCW-taken RDTs (96.7\%, 58/60, 95\% CI 92.1-100.0) were not significantly different (p=0.262). However, the NPV of self-taken swab RDTs was significantly higher (96.1\%, 173/180, 95\% CI: 93.2-98.9) than HCW-taken RDTs (91.5\%, 172/188, 95\% CI 87.5-95.5, p=0.003). Conclusion Self-taken swabs for COVID-19 testing offer substantial individual benefits in terms of convenience, accuracy, and reduced risk of transmitting infection. Our results demonstrate that self-taken throat/nasal samples can be used by lay individuals as part of rapid testing programmes for symptomatic adults.

	abstract = {Community-based active case-finding (ACF) may have important impacts on routine TB case-detection and subsequent patient-initiated diagnosis pathways, contributing “indirectly” to infectious diseases prevention and care. We investigated the impact of ACF beyond directly diagnosed patients for TB, using routine case-notification rate (CNR) ratios as a measure of indirect effect. We systematically searched for publications 01-Jan-1980 to 13-Apr-2020 reporting on community-based ACF interventions compared to a comparison group, together with review of linked manuscripts reporting knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) outcomes or qualitative data on TB testing behaviour. We calculated CNR ratios of routine case-notifications (i.e. excluding cases identified directly through ACF) and compared proxy behavioural outcomes for both ACF and comparator communities. Full text manuscripts from 988 of 23,883 abstracts were screened for inclusion; 36 were eligible. Of these, 12 reported routine notification rates separately from ACF intervention-attributed rates, and one reported any proxy behavioural outcomes. Two further studies were identified from screening 1121 abstracts for linked KAP/qualitative manuscripts. 8/12 case-notification studies were considered at critical or serious risk of bias. 8/11 non-randomised studies reported bacteriologically-confirmed CNR ratios between 0.47 (95\% CI:0.41–0.53) and 0.96 (95\% CI:0.94–0.97), with 7/11 reporting all-form CNR ratios between 0.96 (95\% CI:0.88–1.05) and 1.09 (95\% CI:1.02–1.16). One high-quality randomised-controlled trial reported a ratio of 1.14 (95\% CI 0.91–1.43). KAP/qualitative manuscripts provided insufficient evidence to establish the impact of ACF on subsequent TB testing behaviour. ACF interventions with routine CNR ratios {\textgreater}1 suggest an indirect effect on wider TB case-detection, potentially due to impact on subsequent TB testing behaviour through follow-up after a negative ACF test or increased TB knowledge. However, data on this type of impact are rarely collected. Evaluation of routine case-notification, testing and proxy behavioural outcomes in intervention and comparator communities should be included as standard methodology in future ACF campaign study designs.},

	abstract = {Introduction Understanding human mixing patterns relevant to infectious diseases spread through close contact is vital for modelling transmission dynamics and optimisation of disease control strategies. Mixing patterns in low-income countries like Malawi are not well understood.
Methodology We conducted a social mixing survey in urban Blantyre, Malawi between April and July 2021 (between the 2nd and 3rd wave of COVID-19 infections). Participants living in densely-populated neighbourhoods were randomly sampled and, if they consented, reported their physical and non-physical contacts within and outside homes lasting at least 5 minutes during the previous day. Age-specific mixing rates were calculated, and a negative binomial mixed effects model was used to estimate determinants of contact behaviour.
Results Of 1,201 individuals enrolled, 702 (58.5\%) were female, the median age was 15 years (interquartile range [IQR] 5-32) and 127 (10.6\%) were HIV-positive. On average, participants reported 10.3 contacts per day (range: 1-25). Mixing patterns were highly age-assortative, particularly those within the community and with skin-to-skin contact. Adults aged 20-49y reported the most contacts (median:11, IQR: 8-15) of all age groups; 38\% (95\%CI: 16-63) more than infants (median: 8, IQR: 5-10), who had the least contacts. Household contact frequency increased by 3\% (95\%CI 2-5) per additional household member. Unemployed participants had 15\% (95\%CI: 9-21) fewer contacts than other adults. Among long range ({\textgreater}30 meters away from home) contacts, secondary school children had the largest median contact distance from home (257m, IQR 78-761). HIV-positive status in adults {\textgreater}18 years-old was not associated with increased contact patterns (1\%, 95\%CI -9-12). During this period of relatively low COVID-19 incidence in Malawi, 301 (25.1\%) individuals stated that they had limited their contact with others due to COVID-19 precautions; however, their reported contacts were not fewer (8\%, 95\%CI 1-13).
Conclusion In urban Malawi, contact rates, are high and age-assortative, with little behavioural change due to either HIV-status or COVID-19 circulation. This highlights the limits of contact-restriction-based mitigation strategies in such settings and the need for pandemic preparedness to better understand how contact reductions can be enabled and motivated.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Household contact tracing for tuberculosis (TB) may facilitate TB diagnosis and identify individuals who may benefit from TB preventive therapy (TPT). In this cluster-randomised trial, we investigated whether household contact tracing and intensive TB/HIV screening would improve TB-free survival.
METHODS: Household contacts of index TB patients in two Provinces of South Africa were randomised to home tracing and intensive HIV/TB screening (sputum Xpert and culture; HIV testing with treatment linkage; and TPT, if eligible), or standard of care (SOC, clinic referral letters). The primary outcome was incident TB or death at 15-months. Secondary outcomes included tuberculin skin test (TST) positivity in children ≤14 years and undiagnosed HIV. (ISRCTN16006202).
RESULTS: From December 2016-March 2019, 1,032 index patients (4,459 contacts) and 1,030 (4,129 contacts) were randomised to the intervention and SOC arms. 3.2\% (69/2166) of intervention arm contacts had prevalent microbiologically-confirmed TB. At 15-months, the cumulative incidence of TB or death did not differ between the intensive screening (93/3230, 2.9\%) and SOC (80/2600, 3.1\%) arms (hazard ratio: 0.90, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.66-1.24). TST positivity was higher in the intensive screening arm (38/845, 4.5\%) compared to the SOC arm (15/800, 1.9\%, odds ratio: 2.25, 95\% CI: 1.07-4.72). Undiagnosed HIV was similar between arms (41/3185, 1.3\% vs. 32/2543, 1.3\%; odds ratio: 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.64-1.64).
CONCLUSIONS: Household contact tracing with intensive screening and referral did not reduce incident TB or death. Providing referral letters to household contacts of index patients is an alternative strategy to home visits in high TB/HIV-prevalence settings.},

	abstract = {Background People living with HIV (PLHIV) have a high risk of death if hospitalised in low-income countries. Tuberculosis has long been the leading cause of admission and death, in part due to suboptimal diagnostics. Two promising new diagnostic tools are digital chest Xray with computer-aided diagnosis (DCXR-CAD) and urine testing with Fujifilm SILVAMP LAM (FujiLAM). Neither test has been rigorously evaluated among inpatients. Test characteristics may be complementary, with FujiLAM especially sensitive for disseminated tuberculosis and DCXR-CAD especially sensitive for pulmonary tuberculosis, making combined interventions of interest. Design and methods An exploratory unblinded, single site, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial, with day of admission as the unit of randomisation. A third, smaller, integrated cohort arm (4:4:1 random allocation) contributes to understanding case-mix, but not trial outcomes. Participants are adults living with HIV not currently on TB treatment. The intervention (DCXR-CAD plus urine FujiLAM plus usual care) is compared to usual care alone. The primary outcome is proportion of participants started on tuberculosis treatment by day 56, with secondary outcomes of mortality (time to event) measured to to 56 days from enrolment, proportions with undiagnosed tuberculosis at death or hospital discharge and comparing proportions with enrolment-day tuberculosis treatment initiation. Discussion Both DCXR-CAD and FujiLAM have potential clinical utility and may have complementary diagnostic performance. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial to evaluate these tests among hospitalised PLHIV.},

	abstract = {Pakistan\&rsquo;s national tuberculosis control programme (NTP) is among the many programmes worldwide that value the importance of subnational tuberculosis (TB) burden estimates to support disease control efforts, but do not have reliable estimates. A hackathon was thus organised to solicit the development and comparison of several models for small area estimation of TB. The TB hackathon was launched in April 2019. Participating teams were requested to produce district-level estimates of bacteriologically positive TB prevalence among adults (over 15 years of age) for 2018. The NTP provided case-based data from their 2010\&ndash;2011 TB prevalence survey, along with data relating to TB screening, testing and treatment for the period between 2010\&ndash;2011 and 2018. Five teams submitted district-level TB prevalence estimates, methodological details and programming code. Although the geographical distribution of TB prevalence varied considerably across models, we identified several districts with consistently low notification-to-prevalence ratios. The hackathon highlighted the challenges of generating granular spatiotemporal TB prevalence forecasts based on a cross-sectional prevalence survey data and other data sources. Nevertheless, it provided a range of approaches to subnational disease modelling. The NTP\&rsquo;s use and plans for these outputs shows that, limitations notwithstanding, they can be valuable for programme planning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of patients with symptoms is the foundation of facility-based TB screening and diagnosis, but underdiagnosis is common. We conducted this systematic review with the hypothesis that underdiagnosis is largely secondary to patient drop out along the diagnostic and care pathway. METHODS: We searched (up to 22 January 2019) MEDLINE, Embase, and Cinahl for studies investigating patient pathway to TB diagnosis and care at health facilities. We used Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) to assess risk of bias. We reported proportions of patients with symptoms at each stage of the pathway from symptom screening to treatment initiation. RESULTS: After screening 3,558 abstracts, we identified 16 eligible studies. None provided data addressing the full cascade of care from clinical presentation to treatment initiation in the same patient population. Symptom screening, the critical entry point for diagnosis of TB, was not done for 3396\% of participants with symptoms in the three studies that reported this outcome. The proportion of attendees with symptoms offered a diagnostic investigation (data available for 15 studies) was very low with a study level median of 38\% (IQR 1444, range 484) CONCLUSIONS: Inefficiencies of the TB symptom screen-based patient pathway are a major contributor to underdiagnosis of TB, reflecting inconsistent implementation of guidelines to ask all patients attending health facilities about respiratory symptoms and to offer diagnostic tests to all patients promptly once TB symptoms are identified. Better screening tools and interventions to improve the efficiency of TB screening and diagnosis pathways in health facilities are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Local information is needed to guide targeted interventions for respiratory infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Case notification rates (CNRs) are readily available, but systematically underestimate true disease burden in neighbourhoods with high diagnostic access barriers. We explored a novel approach, adjusting CNRs for under-notification (P:N ratio) using neighbourhood-level predictors of TB prevalence-to-notification ratios. We analysed data from 1) a citywide routine TB surveillance system including geolocation, confirmatory mycobacteriology, and clinical and demographic characteristics of all registering TB patients in Blantyre, Malawi during 2015–19, and 2) an adult TB prevalence survey done in 2019. In the prevalence survey, consenting adults from randomly selected households in 72 neighbourhoods had symptom-plus-chest X-ray screening, confirmed with sputum smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/Rif and culture. Bayesian multilevel models were used to estimate adjusted neighbourhood prevalence-to-notification ratios, based on summarised posterior draws from fitted adult bacteriologically-confirmed TB CNRs and prevalence. From 2015–19, adult bacteriologically-confirmed CNRs were 131 (479/371,834), 134 (539/415,226), 114 (519/463,707), 56 (283/517,860) and 46 (258/578,377) per 100,000 adults per annum, and 2019 bacteriologically-confirmed prevalence was 215 (29/13,490) per 100,000 adults. Lower educational achievement by household head and neighbourhood distance to TB clinic was negatively associated with CNRs. The mean neighbourhood P:N ratio was 4.49 (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 0.98–11.91), consistent with underdiagnosis of TB, and was most pronounced in informal peri-urban neighbourhoods. Here we have demonstrated a method for the identification of neighbourhoods with high levels of under-diagnosis of TB without the requirement for a prevalence survey; this is important since prevalence surveys are expensive and logistically challenging. If confirmed, this approach may support more efficient and effective targeting of intensified TB and HIV case-finding interventions aiming to accelerate elimination of urban TB.},
