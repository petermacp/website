  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injuries are a major cause of disability globally and injury incidence is rapidly increasing, largely due to road traffic injuries in low-income and middle-income countries. Current estimates of the scale and consequences of disability from injury are largely based on modelling studies, with a scarcity of empirical evidence from severe injuries in low-income countries. We aimed to better understand the outcomes for individuals with open tibia fractures in Malawi.
METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective cohort study, adults (aged ≥18 years) with open tibia fractures were systematically recruited at six hospitals in Malawi (two tertiary hospitals and four district hospitals). Follow-up lasted at least 1 year, during which in-person follow-up reviews were done at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-injury. The primary outcome was function at 1 year post-injury, measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA) score. Secondary outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; as determined via the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 3-Levels [EQ-5D-3L] survey) and fracture-related infection at 1 year post-injury. Multilevel regression models investigated associations between SMFA score, EQ-5D-3L, baseline factors, and orthopaedic management.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2021, and March 14, 2022, 287 participants were enrolled (median age 34 years [IQR 25-44]; 84% male). The most common mode of injury was road traffic injuries (194 [68%] of 287). Overall, 268 (93%) participants had debridement; of the 63 participants who were debrided in district hospitals, 47 (75%) had the procedure under local or no anaesthesia. Following substantial declines by 6 weeks after injury, function and quality of life had not recovered by 1 year post-injury for participants with Gustilo grade I-II fractures (posterior mean SMFA at 1 year: 10·5, 95% highest density interval [HDI]: 9·5-11·6; QALYs: 0·73, 95% HDI: 0·66-0·80) nor Gustilo grade III fractures (posterior mean SMFA at 1 year: 14·9, 95% HDI: 13·4-16·6; QALYs: 0·67, 95% HDI: 0·59-0·75). For all fracture grades, intramedullary nailing substantially improved function and quality of life at 1 year post-injury. Delayed definitive fixation after 5 days had 5-times greater odds of infection compared with early management within 2 days (adjusted odds ratio: 5·1, 95% CI 1·8-16·1; p=0·02).
INTERPRETATION: Adults with open tibia fractures in Malawi have poor function and quality of life in the 1 year following injury. Centralised orthopaedic surgical management, including early definitive fixation and intramedullary nailing for more severe injuries, might improve outcomes.
