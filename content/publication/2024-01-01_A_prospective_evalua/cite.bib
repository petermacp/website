  abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD4 measurement is pivotal in the management of advanced HIV disease. VISITECT® CD4 Advanced Disease (AccuBio Limited, Alva, UK; VISITECT) is an instrument-free, point-of-care, semi-quantitative test allowing visual identification of a CD4 ≤200 cells/µl, or \textgreater200 cells/µl from finger-prick or venous blood.
METHODS: As part of a diagnostic accuracy study of FUJIFILM SILVAMP TB LAM (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04089423), people living with HIV of ≥18 years old were prospectively recruited in seven countries from outpatient departments if a tuberculosis symptom was present, and from inpatient departments. Participants provided venous blood for CD4 measurement using flow cytometry (reference standard) and finger-prick blood for VISITECT (index text), performed at point-of-care. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of VISITECT to determine a CD4 ≤200 cells/µl were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 1604 participants, the median flow cytometry CD4 was 367 (IQR 128-626) cells/µl and 521 (32.5%) had a CD4 ≤200 cells/µl. VISITECT sensitivity was 92.7% (483/521, 95% CI 90.1-94.7%) and specificity was 61.4% (665/1083, 95% CI 58.4-64.3%). For participants with a CD4 between 0-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-500, and \textgreater500 cells/µl, VISITECT misclassified 4.5% (95% CI 2.5-7.2%), 12.5 (95% CI 8.0-18.2%), 74.1% (95% CI 67.0-80.5%), 48.0% (95% CI 42.5-53.6%), and 22.6% (95% CI 19.3-26.3%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: VISITECT's sensitivity, but not specificity, met the World Health Organization's minimal sensitivity and specificity threshold of 80% for point-of-care CD4 tests. VISITECT's quality needs to be assessed and its accuracy optimized. VISITECT´s utility as CD4 triage test should be investigated.},
