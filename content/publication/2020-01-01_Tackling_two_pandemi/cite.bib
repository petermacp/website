  abstract = {We are facing an unprecedented pandemic. A quarter of the world's population is infected
and, between 2020 and 2021, it is predicted that 10 million people will have fallen
ill, 3 million will not have been diagnosed or received care, and more than 1 million—mainly
the most vulnerable—will have died.1 This pandemic is not COVID-19 but tuberculosis.
On World Tuberculosis Day, it is worth comparing the COVID-19 and tuberculosis pandemics
to ensure that, while we focus on the former, we do not forget the latter.},
