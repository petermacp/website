  abstract = {Huntington disease presents many challenges for the anesthetist. Of primary importance is that these patients are at increased risk of pulmonary aspiration. The use of short-acting anesthetic drugs should, therefore, be advantageous in promoting the rapid return of protective airway reflexes. We report the first documented use, to date, of propofol and remifentanil total intravenous anesthesia in a patient with Huntington disease and demonstrate its efficacy and safety.},
