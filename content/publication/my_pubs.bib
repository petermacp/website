Mathematical models to forecast the long-term effects of ACF require empirical measurements of the yield, timing and costs of case detection. Pragmatic trials offer an opportunity to assess the cost-effectiveness of ACF interventions within a ‘real-world´ context. However, such
analyses generally require early introduction of economic evaluations to enable prospective data collection on resource requirements. Closing the global case-detection gap will require substantial additional resources, including continued investment in innovative technologies. Research is
essential to the optimal implementation, cost-effectiveness, and affordability of ACF in high-burden settings. To assess the value of ACF, we must prioritize the collection of high-quality data regarding costs and effectiveness, and link those data to analytical models that are adapted to
local settings.},

DESIGN: This was a cohort study of all TB cases from North West England diagnosed between 27 March 2012 and 28 June 2016. The social risk factors of TB cases were evaluated to estimate their need for enhanced case management (ECM), from 0 (standard of care) to 3 (intensive social support).
RESULTS: A total of 2139 cases and their 10 019 contacts met the eligibility criteria. Being a contact of a patient with smear-positive TB with high ECM or being of Black Caribbean ethnicity was independently associated with greater odds of active TB disease (smear-positive vs. smear-negative, OR 5.3, 95\%CI 3.2-8.7; ECM-3 vs. ECM-0, OR 2.2, 95\%CI 1.01-5.0; Black Caribbean vs. White, OR 7.4, 95\%CI 2.1-25). Being a contact of a patient with smear-positive TB or of Black Caribbean ethnicity was also independently associated with greater odds of tuberculous infection (smear-positive vs. smear-negative, OR 5.3, 95\%CI 3.8-7.3; and Black Caribbean vs. White, OR 6.7, 95\%CI 2.0-25).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of patients with symptoms is the foundation of facility-based TB screening and diagnosis, but underdiagnosis is common. We conducted this systematic review with the hypothesis that underdiagnosis is largely secondary to patient drop out along the diagnostic and care pathway. METHODS: We searched (up to 22 January 2019) MEDLINE, Embase, and Cinahl for studies investigating patient pathway to TB diagnosis and care at health facilities. We used Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) to assess risk of bias. We reported proportions of patients with symptoms at each stage of the pathway from symptom screening to treatment initiation. RESULTS: After screening 3,558 abstracts, we identified 16 eligible studies. None provided data addressing the full cascade of care from clinical presentation to treatment initiation in the same patient population. Symptom screening, the critical entry point for diagnosis of TB, was not done for 3396\% of participants with symptoms in the three studies that reported this outcome. The proportion of attendees with symptoms offered a diagnostic investigation (data available for 15 studies) was very low with a study level median of 38\% (IQR 1444, range 484) CONCLUSIONS: Inefficiencies of the TB symptom screen-based patient pathway are a major contributor to underdiagnosis of TB, reflecting inconsistent implementation of guidelines to ask all patients attending health facilities about respiratory symptoms and to offer diagnostic tests to all patients promptly once TB symptoms are identified. Better screening tools and interventions to improve the efficiency of TB screening and diagnosis pathways in health facilities are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
          Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been suggested to be associated with an increased risk of the development of nonunion after a fracture. This prospective matched case–control study in South Africa investigated common risk factors, including HIV status, that influence the development of a nonunion after a femur or tibia fracture.
          Methods: 
          Adult participants (cases) with established nonunions of the femur or tibia shaft were recruited over a 16-month period, between December 2017 and April 2019. They were matched for (1) age; (2) sex; (3) fracture site; and (4) fracture management type, with “control” participants who progressed to fracture union within 6 months of injury. All participants were tested for HIV. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to investigate associations between known risk factors for the development of nonunion and impaired fracture healing.
          Results: 
          A total of 57 cases were matched with 57 “control” participants (44/57 male, 77.2\% vs. 13/57 female, 22.8\%, median age 36 years). HIV status was not associated with the development of nonunion after the management of tibia and femur fractures, on both univariate (odds ratio, 0.40; confidence interval, 0.10–1.32; P = 0.151) or multivariable (odds ratio, 0.86; confidence interval, 0.18–3.73; P = 0.831) analysis. No other confounding factors were shown to have any statistically significant impact on the odds of developing nonunion in this study cohort.
          Conclusion: 
          This study demonstrates that HIV does not seem to increase the risk of the development of nonunion and HIV-positive individuals who sustain a fracture can be managed in the same manner as those who are HIV negative.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) killed more people globally than any other single pathogen over the past decade. Where surveillance is weak, estimating TB burden estimates uses modeling. In many African countries, increases in HIV prevalence and antiretroviral therapy have driven dynamic TB epidemics, complicating estimation of burden, trends, and potential intervention impact. We therefore develop a novel age-structured TB transmission model incorporating evolving demographic, HIV and antiretroviral therapy effects, and calibrate to TB prevalence and notification data from 12 African countries. We use Bayesian methods to include uncertainty for all TB model parameters, and estimate age-specific annual risks of TB infection, finding up to 16.0\%/year in adults, and the proportion of TB incidence from recent (re)infection, finding a mean across countries of 34\%. Rapid reduction of the unacceptably high burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings will require interventions addressing progression as well as transmission. Accurately estimating the burden of tuberculosis is challenging due to incomplete registration systems and the relationship with HIV. Here, the authors develop a Bayesian modelling strategy accounting for these factors that estimates age- and country-specific annual risks of infection and the proportion resulting from recent infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical practice and diagnostic algorithms often assume that tuberculosis can be ruled out in mycobacteriology-negative individuals whose symptoms improve with a trial-of-antibiotics. We aimed to investigate diagnostic performance, clinical benefit, and antimicrobial resistance using a randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: In this three-arm, individually randomised, open-label, controlled trial, we enrolled Malawian adults (aged ≥18 years) attending primary care who reported being unwell for at least 14 days (including cough) with no immediate indication for hospitalisation at Limbe and Ndirande Health Centres in Blantyre. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to azithromycin (500 mg taken once per day for 3 days), amoxicillin (1 g taken three times per day for 5 days), or standard of care with no immediate antibiotics, stratified by study site. Sputum at enrolment and day 8 was tested for tuberculosis (microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF, and culture). The primary efficacy outcome was day 8 specificity (percentage with symptom improvement among mycobacteriology-negative participants), and day 29 clinical outcome (death, hospitalisation, or missed tuberculosis diagnosis) among all randomised participants. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03545373.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 25, 2019, and March 14, 2020, 5825 adults were screened and 1583 (mean age 36 years; 236 [14·9\%] HIV positive) were randomly assigned to standard of care (530 participants), azithromycin (527 participants), or amoxicillin (526 participants) groups. Overall, 6·3\% (100 of 1583 participants) had positive baseline sputum mycobacteriology. 310 (79·1\%) of 392 patients receiving standard of care reported symptom improvement at day 8, compared with 340 (88·7\%) of 383 patients receiving azithromycin (adjusted difference 8·6\%, 95\% CI 3·9-13·3\%; p{\textless}0·0004) and 346 (89·4\%) of 387 receiving amoxicillin (adjusted difference 8·8\%, 4·0-13·6\%; p=0·0003). The proportion of participants with day 29 composite clinical outcomes was similar between groups (standard of care 1\% [7 of 530 participants], azithromycin 1\% [6 of 527 participants], amoxicillin 2\% [12 of 526 participants]).
INTERPRETATION: Routine outpatient trial-of-antibiotics during tuberculosis investigations modestly improved diagnostic specificity for mycobacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis but had no appreciable effect on death, hospitalisation, and missed tuberculosis diagnosis. These results confirm the limited benefit of trial-of-antibiotics, presenting an opportunity for discontinuation of trial-of-antibiotics and improved antimicrobial stewardship during tuberculosis screening, without affecting clinical outcomes.

We systematically appraised evidence for interventions to reduce mortality among hospitalised PLHIV in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

We excluded studies restricted only to inpatients with a specific diagnosis (e.g. cryptococcal meningitis). Of 19,970 unique studies identified in search, ten were eligible for inclusion with 7,531 participants in total: nine randomised trials, and one before-after study. Three trials investigated systematic screening for tuberculosis; two showed survival benefit for urine TB screening vs. no urine screening, and one which compared Xpert MTB/RIF versus smear microscopy showed no difference in survival. One before-after study implemented 2007 WHO guidelines to improve management of smear negative tuberculosis in severely ill PLHIV, and showed survival benefit but with high risk of bias. Two trials evaluated complex interventions aimed at overcoming barriers to ART initiation in newly diagnosed PLHIV, one of which showed survival benefit and the other no difference. Two small trials evaluated early inpatient ART start, with no difference in survival. Two trials investigated protocol-driven fluid resuscitation for emergency-room attendees meeting case-definitions for sepsis, and showed increased mortality with use of a protocol for fluid administration. In conclusion, ten studies published since 2003 investigated interventions that aimed to reduce mortality in hospitalised adults with HIV, and weren’t restricted to people with a defined disease diagnosis. Inpatient trials of diagnostics, therapeutics or a package of interventions to reduce mortality should be a research priority.

	abstract = {Background
To determine if tuberculosis (TB) screening improves patient outcomes, we conducted two systematic reviews to investigate the effect of TB screening on diagnosis, treatment outcomes, deaths (clinical review assessing 23 outcome indicators); and patient costs (economic review).
Methods
Pubmed, EMBASE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library were searched between 1/1/1980-13/4/2020 (clinical review) and 1/1/2010-14/8/2020 (economic review). As studies were heterogeneous, data synthesis was narrative.
Findings
Clinical review: of 27,270 articles, 18 (n=3 trials) were eligible. Nine involved general populations. Compared to passive case finding (PCF), studies showed lower smear grade (n=2/3) and time to diagnosis (n=2/3); higher pre-treatment losses to follow-up (screened 23\% and 29\% vs PCF 15\% and 14\%; n=2/2); and similar treatment success (range 68-81\%; n=4) and case fatality (range 3-11\%; n=5) in the screened group. Nine reported on risk groups. Compared to PCF, studies showed lower smear positivity among those culture-confirmed (n=3/4) and time to diagnosis (n=2/2); and similar (range 80-90\%; n=2/2) treatment success in the screened group. Case fatality was lower in n=2/3 observational studies; both reported on established screening programmes. A neonatal trial and post-hoc analysis of a household contacts trial found screening was associated with lower all-cause mortality. Economic review: From 2841 articles, six observational studies were eligible. Total costs (n=6) and catastrophic cost prevalence (n=4; range screened 9-45\% vs PCF 12-61\%) was lower among those screened.
Interpretation
We found very limited patient outcome data. Collecting and reporting this data must be prioritised to inform policy and practice.

Evaluation of triage tests should occur in settings of intended use, such as community and primary healthcare centers. Important considerations for triage test evaluation include study design, population, sample type, test throughput, use of thresholds, reference standard (ideally culture), and specimen flow.

This study aimed at determining factors associated with delayed PTB diagnosis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. Methods. A retrospective observational study was done using clinic records of HIV-infected PTB suspects attending an HIV/AIDS clinic at Tintswalo rural hospital in South Africa (SA) between January 2006 and December 2007. Using routine clinic registers, 480 records were identified. Results. PTB diagnosis delay was found among 77/176 (43.8\%) of the patients diagnosed with PTB. The mean delay of PTB diagnosis was 170.6 days; diagnosis delay ranged 1-30 days in 27 (35.1\%) patients, 31-180 days in 24 (33.8\%) patients; 24 (31.2\%) patients remained undiagnosed for ≥180 days. Independent factors associated with delayed diagnosis were: older age {\textgreater}40 years (Odds Ratio (OR) 3.43, 95\% CI 1.45-8.08) and virological failure (OR 2.72, 95\% CI 1.09-6.74). Conclusion. There is a considerable delayed PTB diagnosis among HIV-infected patients in rural SA. Older patients as well as patients with high viral load are at a higher risk of PTB diagnosis delay. Therefore efforts to reduce PTB diagnosis delay need to emphasised.},

	abstract = {Community-based screening for tuberculosis (TB) could improve detection but is resource intensive. We set out to evaluate the accuracy of computer-aided TB screening using digital chest X-ray (CXR) to determine if this approach met target product profiles (TPP) for community-based screening. CXR images from participants in the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey were evaluated using CAD4TBv6 (Delft Imaging), giving a probabilistic score for pulmonary TB ranging from 0 (low probability) to 99 (high probability). We constructed a Bayesian latent class model to estimate the accuracy of CAD4TBv6 screening compared to bacteriologically-confirmed TB across CAD4TBv6 threshold cut-offs, incorporating data on Clinical Officer CXR interpretation, participant demographics (age, sex, TB symptoms, previous TB history), and sputum results. We compared model-estimated sensitivity and specificity of CAD4TBv6 to optimum and minimum TPPs. Of 63,050 prevalence survey participants, 61,848 (98\%) had analysable CXR images, and 8,966 (14.5\%) underwent sputum bacteriological testing; 298 had bacteriologically-confirmed pulmonary TB. Median CAD4TBv6 scores for participants with bacteriologically-confirmed TB were significantly higher (72, IQR: 58–82.75) compared to participants with bacteriologically-negative sputum results (49, IQR: 44–57, p{\textless}0.0001). CAD4TBv6 met the optimum TPP; with the threshold set to achieve a mean sensitivity of 95\% (optimum TPP), specificity was 83.3\%, (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 83.0\%—83.7\%, CAD4TBv6 threshold: 55). There was considerable variation in accuracy by participant characteristics, with older individuals and those with previous TB having lowest specificity. CAD4TBv6 met the optimal TPP for TB community screening. To optimise screening accuracy and efficiency of confirmatory sputum testing, we recommend that an adaptive approach to threshold setting is adopted based on participant characteristics.},

	abstract = {Background Household contact tracing provides TB screening and TB preventive therapy (TPT) to contacts at high risk of TB disease. However, it is resource intensive, inconvenient, and often poorly implemented. We investigated a novel model aiming to improve uptake. Methods Between May and December 2014, we randomised patient with TB who consented to participate in the trial to either standard of care (SOC) or intervention (PACTS) arms. Participants randomised to PACTS received one screening/triage tool (adapted from WHO integrated management of adolescent and adult illnesses [IMAI] guidelines) and sputum pots for each reported household contact. The tool guided participants through symptom screening; TPT (6-months of isoniazid) eligibility; and sputum collection for contacts. Patients randomised to SOC were managed in accordance with national guidelines, that is, they received verbal instruction on who to bring to clinics for investigation using national guidelines. Main outcome and measures The primary outcome was the proportion of adult contacts receiving treatment for TB within 3 months of randomisation. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of child contacts under age 5 years (U5Y) who were commenced on, and completed, TPT. Data were analyzed by logistic regression with random effects to adjust for household clustering. Results Two hundred and fourteen index TB participants were block-randomized from two sites (107 PACTS, reporting 418 contacts; and 107 SOC, reporting 420 contacts). Overall, 62.8\% of index TB participants were HIV-positive and 52.1\% were TB culture-positive. 250 otherwise eligible TB patients declined participation and 6 households (10 PACTS, 6 SOC) were lost to follow-up and were not included in the analysis. By three months, nine contacts (PACTS: 6, [1.4\%]; SOC: 3, [0.7\%]) had TB diagnosed, with no difference between groups (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.18, 95\% CI: 0.60–7.95). Eligible PACTS contacts (37/96, 38.5\%) were more likely to initiate TPT by 3-months compared to SOC contacts (27/101, 26.7\%; aOR 2.27, 95\% CI: 1.04–4.98). U5Y children in the PACTS arm (47/81 58.0\%) were more likely to have initiated TPT before the 3-month visit compared to SOC children (36/89, 41.4\%; aOR: 2.31, 95\% CI: 1.05–5.06). Conclusions and relevance A household-centred patient-delivered symptom screen and IPT eligibility assessment significantly increased timely TPT uptake among U5Y children, but did not significantly increase TB diagnosis. This model needs to be optimized for acceptability, given low participation, and investigated in other low resource settings.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) developed for point of care detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen are recommended by WHO to use trained health care workers to collect samples. We hypothesised that self-taken samples are non-inferior for use with RDTs to diagnose COVID-19. We designed a prospective diagnostic evaluation comparing self-taken and healthcare worker (HCW)-taken throat/nasal swabs to perform RDTs for SARS-CoV-2, and how these compare to RT-PCR.
METHODS: Eligible participants 18 years or older with symptoms of COVID-19. 250 participants recruited at the NHS Test and Trace drive-through community PCR testing site (Liverpool, UK); one withdrew before analysis. Self-administered throat/nasal swab for the Covios® RDT, a trained HCW taken throat/nasal sample for PCR and HCW comparison throat/nasal swab for RDT were collected. RDT results were compared to RT-PCR, as the reference standard, to calculate sensitivity and specificity.
FINDINGS: Seventy-five participants (75/249, 30.1\%) were positive by RT-PCR. RDTs with self-taken swabs had a sensitivity of 90.5\% (67/74, 95\% CI: 83.9-97.2), compared to 78.4\% (58/74, 95\% CI: 69.0-87.8) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 12.2\%, 95\% CI: 4.7-19.6, p = 0.003). Specificity for self-taken swabs was 99.4\% (173/174, 95\% CI: 98.3-100.0), versus 98.9\% (172/174, 95\% CI: 97.3-100.0) for HCW-taken swabs (absolute difference 0.6\%, 95\% CI: 0.5-1.7, p = 0.317). The PPV of self-taken RDTs (98.5\%, 67/68, 95\% CI: 95.7-100.0) and HCW-taken RDTs (96.7\%, 58/60, 95\% CI 92.1-100.0) were not significantly different (p = 0.262). However, the NPV of self-taken swab RDTs was significantly higher (96.1\%, 173/180, 95\% CI: 93.2-98.9) than HCW-taken RDTs (91.5\%, 172/188, 95\% CI 87.5-95.5, p = 0.003).
INTERPRETATION: In conclusion, self-taken swabs for COVID-19 testing offer an accurate alternative to healthcare worker taken swabs for use with RDTs. Our results demonstrate that, with no training, self-taken throat/nasal samples can be used by lay individuals as part of rapid testing programmes for symptomatic adults. This is especially important where the lack of trained healthcare workers restricts access to testing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains a major public health priority and is the second leading cause of mortality from infectious disease worldwide. TB case detection rates are unacceptably low for men, the elderly and children. Disruptions in TB services due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated these and other inequalities.
METHODS: We modelled trends in age- and sex- disaggregated case notifications for all forms of new and relapse TB reported to the World Health Organization for 45 high TB, TB/HIV and MDR-TB burden countries from 2013 to 2019. We compared trend predicted notifications to observed notifications in 2020 to estimate the number of people with TB likely to have missed or delayed diagnosis. We estimated the risk ratio (RR) of missed or delayed TB diagnosis for children (aged {\textless} 15 years) or the elderly (aged ≥ 65 years) compared to adults (aged 15-64 years) and women compared to men (both aged ≥ 15 years) using a random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: An estimated 195,449 children (95\% confidence interval, CI: 189,673-201,562, 37.8\% of an expected 517,168), 1,126,133 adults (CI: 1,107,146-1,145,704, 21.8\% of an expected 5,170,592) and 235,402 elderly (CI: 228,108-243,202, 28.5\% of an expected 826,563) had a missed or delayed TB diagnosis in 2020. This included 511,546 women (CI: 499,623-523,869, 22.7\%, of an expected 2,250,097) and 863,916 men (CI: 847,591-880,515, 23.0\% of an expected 3,763,363). There was no evidence globally that the risk of having TB diagnosis missed or delayed was different for children and adults (RR: 1.09, CI: 0.41-2.91), the elderly and adults (RR: 1.40, CI: 0.62-3.16) or men and women (RR: 0.59, CI: 0.25-1.42). However, there was evidence of disparities in risk by age and/or sex in some WHO regions and in most countries.
CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence at an aggregate global level of any difference by age or sex in the risk of disruption to TB diagnosis as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in many countries, disruptions in TB services have been greater for some groups than others. It is important to recognise these context-specific inequalities when prioritising key populations for catch-up campaigns.},

	abstract = {Local information is needed to guide targeted interventions for respiratory infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Case notification rates (CNRs) are readily available, but systematically underestimate true disease burden in neighbourhoods with high diagnostic access barriers. We explored a novel approach, adjusting CNRs for under-notification (P:N ratio) using neighbourhood-level predictors of TB prevalence-to-notification ratios. We analysed data from 1) a citywide routine TB surveillance system including geolocation, confirmatory mycobacteriology, and clinical and demographic characteristics of all registering TB patients in Blantyre, Malawi during 2015–19, and 2) an adult TB prevalence survey done in 2019. In the prevalence survey, consenting adults from randomly selected households in 72 neighbourhoods had symptom-plus-chest X-ray screening, confirmed with sputum smear microscopy, Xpert MTB/Rif and culture. Bayesian multilevel models were used to estimate adjusted neighbourhood prevalence-to-notification ratios, based on summarised posterior draws from fitted adult bacteriologically-confirmed TB CNRs and prevalence. From 2015–19, adult bacteriologically-confirmed CNRs were 131 (479/371,834), 134 (539/415,226), 114 (519/463,707), 56 (283/517,860) and 46 (258/578,377) per 100,000 adults per annum, and 2019 bacteriologically-confirmed prevalence was 215 (29/13,490) per 100,000 adults. Lower educational achievement by household head and neighbourhood distance to TB clinic was negatively associated with CNRs. The mean neighbourhood P:N ratio was 4.49 (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 0.98–11.91), consistent with underdiagnosis of TB, and was most pronounced in informal peri-urban neighbourhoods. Here we have demonstrated a method for the identification of neighbourhoods with high levels of under-diagnosis of TB without the requirement for a prevalence survey; this is important since prevalence surveys are expensive and logistically challenging. If confirmed, this approach may support more efficient and effective targeting of intensified TB and HIV case-finding interventions aiming to accelerate elimination of urban TB.},

	abstract = {Background People living with HIV (PLHIV) have a high risk of death if hospitalised in low-income countries. Tuberculosis has long been the leading cause of admission and death, in part due to suboptimal diagnostics. Two promising new diagnostic tools are digital chest Xray with computer-aided diagnosis (DCXR-CAD) and urine testing with Fujifilm SILVAMP LAM (FujiLAM). Neither test has been rigorously evaluated among inpatients. Test characteristics may be complementary, with FujiLAM especially sensitive for disseminated tuberculosis and DCXR-CAD especially sensitive for pulmonary tuberculosis, making combined interventions of interest. Design and methods An exploratory unblinded, single site, two-arm cluster randomised controlled trial, with day of admission as the unit of randomisation. A third, smaller, integrated cohort arm (4:4:1 random allocation) contributes to understanding case-mix, but not trial outcomes. Participants are adults living with HIV not currently on TB treatment. The intervention (DCXR-CAD plus urine FujiLAM plus usual care) is compared to usual care alone. The primary outcome is proportion of participants started on tuberculosis treatment by day 56, with secondary outcomes of mortality (time to event) measured to to 56 days from enrolment, proportions with undiagnosed tuberculosis at death or hospital discharge and comparing proportions with enrolment-day tuberculosis treatment initiation. Discussion Both DCXR-CAD and FujiLAM have potential clinical utility and may have complementary diagnostic performance. To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial to evaluate these tests among hospitalised PLHIV.},

We outline evidence suggesting that regular systematic testing of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals could play an important role in reducing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within institutions. We discuss how such a programme might be organised, arguing that frequent testing and rapid reporting of results are particularly important. We highlight studies demonstrating that polymerase chain reaction testing of pooled samples can be undertaken with acceptable loss of sensitivity, and advocate such an approach where test capacity is limited. We provide an approach to calculating the most efficient pool size.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Understanding human mixing patterns relevant to infectious diseases spread through close contact is vital for modelling transmission dynamics and optimisation of disease control strategies. Mixing patterns in low-income countries like Malawi are not well known.
METHODOLOGY: We conducted a social mixing survey in urban Blantyre, Malawi between April and July 2021 (between the 2nd and 3rd wave of COVID-19 infections). Participants living in densely-populated neighbourhoods were randomly sampled and, if they consented, reported their physical and non-physical contacts within and outside homes lasting at least 5 min during the previous day. Age-specific mixing rates were calculated, and a negative binomial mixed effects model was used to estimate determinants of contact behaviour.
RESULTS: Of 1201 individuals enroled, 702 (58.5\%) were female, the median age was 15 years (interquartile range [IQR] 5-32) and 127 (10.6\%) were HIV-positive. On average, participants reported 10.3 contacts per day (range: 1-25). Mixing patterns were highly age-assortative, particularly those within the community and with skin-to-skin contact. Adults aged 20-49 y reported the most contacts (median:11, IQR: 8-15) of all age groups; 38\% (95\%CI: 16-63) more than infants (median: 8, IQR: 5-10), who had the least contacts. Household contact frequency increased by 3\% (95\%CI: 2-5) per additional household member. Unemployed participants had 15\% (95\%CI: 9-21) fewer contacts than other adults. Among long range ({\textgreater}30 m away from home) contacts, secondary school children had the largest median contact distance from home (257 m, IQR 78-761). HIV-positive status in adults {\textgreater}=18 years-old was not associated with changed contact patterns (rate ratio: 1.01, 95\%CI: (0.91-1.12)). During this period of relatively low COVID-19 incidence in Malawi, 301 (25.1\%) individuals stated that they had limited their contact with others due to COVID-19 precautions; however, their reported contacts were 8\% (95\%CI: 1-13) higher.
CONCLUSION: In urban Malawi, contact rates, are high and age-assortative, with little reported behavioural change due to either HIV-status or COVID-19 circulation. This highlights the limits of contact-restriction-based mitigation strategies in such settings and the need for pandemic preparedness to better understand how contact reductions can be enabled and motivated.},

A hackathon was thus organised to solicit the development and comparison of several models for small area estimation of TB. The TB hackathon was launched in April 2019. Participating teams were requested to produce district-level estimates of bacteriologically positive TB prevalence among adults (over 15 years of age) for 2018. The NTP provided case-based data from their 2010\&ndash;2011 TB prevalence survey, along with data relating to TB screening, testing and treatment for the period between 2010\&ndash;2011 and 2018. Five teams submitted district-level TB prevalence estimates, methodological details and programming code. Although the geographical distribution of TB prevalence varied considerably across models, we identified several districts with consistently low notification-to-prevalence ratios. The hackathon highlighted the challenges of generating granular spatiotemporal TB prevalence forecasts based on a cross-sectional prevalence survey data and other data sources. Nevertheless, it provided a range of approaches to subnational disease modelling. The NTP\&rsquo;s use and plans for these outputs shows that, limitations notwithstanding, they can be valuable for programme planning.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Self-testing for HIV infection may contribute to early diagnosis of HIV, but without necessarily increasing antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether offering optional home initiation of HIV care after HIV self-testing might increase demand for ART initiation, compared with HIV self-testing accompanied by facility-based services only.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial conducted in Blantyre, Malawi, between January 30 and November 5, 2012, using restricted 1:1 randomization of 14 community health worker catchment areas. Participants were all adult (≥16 years) residents (n = 16,660) who received access to home HIV self-testing through resident volunteers. This was a second-stage randomization of clusters allocated to the HIV self-testing group of a parent trial.
INTERVENTIONS: Clusters were randomly allocated to facility-based care or optional home initiation of HIV care (including 2 weeks of ART if eligible) for participants reporting positive HIV self-test results.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The preplanned primary outcome compared between groups the proportion of all adult residents who initiated ART within the first 6 months of HIV self-testing availability. Secondary outcomes were uptake of HIV self-testing, reporting of positive HIV self-test results, and rates of loss from ART at 6 months.
RESULTS: A significantly greater proportion of adults in the home group initiated ART (181/8194, 2.2\%) compared with the facility group (63/8466, 0.7\%; risk ratio [RR], 2.94, 95\% CI, 2.10-4.12; P {\textless} .001). Uptake of HIV self-testing was high in both the home (5287/8194, 64.9\%) and facility groups (4433/8466, 52.7\%; RR, 1.23; 95\% CI, 0.96-1.58; P = .10). Significantly more adults reported positive HIV self-test results in the home group (490/8194 [6.0\%] vs the facility group, 278/8466 [3.3\%]; RR, 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.16-2.97; P = .006). After 6 months, 52 of 181 ART initiators (28.7\%) and 15 of 63 ART initiators (23.8\%) in the home and facility groups, respectively, were lost from ART (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.62-2.25, P = .57).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among Malawian adults offered HIV self-testing, optional home initiation of care compared with standard HIV care resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of adults initiating ART.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude of loss to follow-up in smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients before treatment initiation and outcomes among patients who were traced.
METHODS: Ovid Medline and Global Health databases were searched for studies published between 1994 and January 2013 that described pre-treatment loss to follow-up in patients with smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis in routine national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) in low- and lower-middle-income countries and in countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. Data on the proportion of patients who did not initiate treatment after their tuberculosis diagnosis were extracted from studies meeting inclusion criteria. Where available, data on causes and outcomes, including initiation of tuberculosis treatment at another facility, were investigated. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed and random-effects meta-analyses by subgroup (region) were performed.
FINDINGS: Twenty-three eligible studies were identified, with a total of 34 706 smear- or culture-positive tuberculosis patients from 14 countries (8 in Africa, 5 in Asia and 1 in the western Pacific). Most studies were retrospective and linked laboratory and treatment registers to identify pre-treatment loss to follow-up. Pre-treatment loss to follow-up varied from 4 to 38\% and was common in studies from Africa (random-effects weighted proportion, WP: 18\%; 95\% confidence interval, CI: 13-22) and Asia (WP: 13\%; 95\% CI: 10-15).
CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment loss to follow-up, common in most settings, can hinder tuberculosis control efforts. By not counting individuals who are lost to follow-up before treatment when reporting standard programme indicators, NTPs underestimate case detection rates and mortality and overestimate cure rates.},

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of service delivery interventions to improve adolescents' linkage from HIV diagnosis to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, retention in HIV care and adherence to ART.
METHODS: We systematically searched the Medline, SCOPUS and Web of Sciences databases and conference abstracts from the International AIDS Conference and International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA). Studies published in English between 1st January 2001 and 9th June 2014 were included. Two authors independently evaluated reports for eligibility, extracted data and assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Eleven studies from nine countries were eligible for review. Three studies were randomised controlled trials. Interventions assessed included individual and group counselling and education; peer support; directly observed therapy; financial incentives; and interventions to improve the adolescent-friendliness of clinics. Most studies were of low to moderate methodological quality.
CONCLUSIONS: This review identified limited evidence on the effectiveness of service delivery interventions to support adolescents' linkage from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation, retention on ART and adherence to ART. Although recommendations are qualified because of the small numbers of studies and limited methodological quality, offering individual and group education and counselling, financial incentives, increasing clinic accessibility and provision of specific adolescent-tailored services appear promising interventions and warrant further investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Home-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC) achieves high uptake, but is difficult and expensive to implement and sustain. We investigated a novel alternative based on HIV self-testing (HIVST). The aim was to evaluate the uptake of testing, accuracy, linkage into care, and health outcomes when highly convenient and flexible but supported access to HIVST kits was provided to a well-defined and closely monitored population.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Following enumeration of 14 neighbourhoods in urban Blantyre, Malawi, trained resident volunteer-counsellors offered oral HIVST kits (OraQuick ADVANCE Rapid HIV-1/2 Antibody Test) to adult (≥16 y old) residents (n = 16,660) and reported community events, with all deaths investigated by verbal autopsy. Written and demonstrated instructions, pre- and post-test counselling, and facilitated HIV care assessment were provided, with a request to return kits and a self-completed questionnaire. Accuracy, residency, and a study-imposed requirement to limit HIVST to one test per year were monitored by home visits in a systematic quality assurance (QA) sample. Overall, 14,004 (crude uptake 83.8\%, revised to 76.5\% to account for population turnover) residents self-tested during months 1-12, with adolescents (16-19 y) most likely to test. 10,614/14,004 (75.8\%) participants shared results with volunteer-counsellors. Of 1,257 (11.8\%) HIV-positive participants, 26.0\% were already on antiretroviral therapy, and 524 (linkage 56.3\%) newly accessed care with a median CD4 count of 250 cells/μl (interquartile range 159-426). HIVST uptake in months 13-24 was more rapid (70.9\% uptake by 6 mo), with fewer (7.3\%, 95\% CI 6.8\%-7.8\%) positive participants. Being "forced to test", usually by a main partner, was reported by 2.9\% (95\% CI 2.6\%-3.2\%) of 10,017 questionnaire respondents in months 1-12, but satisfaction with HIVST (94.4\%) remained high. No HIVST-related partner violence or suicides were reported. HIVST and repeat HTC results agreed in 1,639/1,649 systematically selected (1 in 20) QA participants (99.4\%), giving a sensitivity of 93.6\% (95\% CI 88.2\%-97.0\%) and a specificity of 99.9\% (95\% CI 99.6\%-100\%). Key limitations included use of aggregate data to report uptake of HIVST and being unable to adjust for population turnover.
CONCLUSIONS: Community-based HIVST achieved high coverage in two successive years and was safe, accurate, and acceptable. Proactive HIVST strategies, supported and monitored by communities, could substantially complement existing approaches to providing early HIV diagnosis and periodic repeat testing to adolescents and adults in high-HIV settings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) case notification rates are usually higher in men than in women, but notification data are insufficient to measure sex differences in disease burden. This review set out to systematically investigate whether sex ratios in case notifications reflect differences in disease prevalence and to identify gaps in access to and/or utilisation of diagnostic services.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In accordance with the published protocol (CRD42015022163), TB prevalence surveys in nationally representative and sub-national adult populations (age ≥ 15 y) in low- and middle-income countries published between 1 January 1993 and 15 March 2016 were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; review of abstracts; and correspondence with the World Health Organization. Random-effects meta-analyses examined male-to-female (M:F) ratios in TB prevalence and prevalence-to-notification (P:N) ratios for smear-positive TB. Meta-regression was done to identify factors associated with higher M:F ratios in prevalence and higher P:N ratios. Eighty-three publications describing 88 surveys with over 3.1 million participants in 28 countries were identified (36 surveys in Africa, three in the Americas, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 in South-East Asia and 17 in the Western Pacific). Fifty-six surveys reported in 53 publications were included in quantitative analyses. Overall random-effects weighted M:F prevalence ratios were 2.21 (95\% CI 1.92-2.54; 56 surveys) for bacteriologically positive TB and 2.51 (95\% CI 2.07-3.04; 40 surveys) for smear-positive TB. M:F prevalence ratios were highest in South-East Asia and in surveys that did not require self-report of signs/symptoms in initial screening procedures. The summary random-effects weighted M:F ratio for P:N ratios was 1.55 (95\% CI 1.25-1.91; 34 surveys). We intended to stratify the analyses by age, HIV status, and rural or urban setting; however, few studies reported such data.
CONCLUSIONS: TB prevalence is significantly higher among men than women in low- and middle-income countries, with strong evidence that men are disadvantaged in seeking and/or accessing TB care in many settings. Global strategies and national TB programmes should recognise men as an underserved high-risk group and improve men's access to diagnostic and screening services to reduce the overall burden of TB more effectively and ensure gender equity in TB care.},

The aims were to determine the relative contribution of death to cohort exit and the causes and predictors of mortality among HAART initiators. A community outreach programme traced non-attenders. Patients categorised as dying at home underwent a verbal autopsy (by interviewing family members) and case-file review, and those dying in hospital a case-file review, to determine the probable cause of death. At 24 months 1131 (83.6\%) patients were retained on treatment in the programme, 124 (9.2\%) had died, 63 (4.7\%) had transferred out, and 35 (2.6\%) were lost to follow-up. The most common causes of death were tuberculosis (44.3\%) and diarrhoeal diseases (24.5\%). Death was the major reason for cohort exit. As experience is gained with rural HAART programmes mortality rates may decrease. These results draw attention to the need for early HIV diagnosis, increased access to HAART services with earlier treatment initiation, and routine screening and aggressive management of opportunistic infections, particularly tuberculosis.},

This review aimed to determine the proportion of adolescents achieving virological suppression after initiating ART.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies published between January 2004 and September 2014 including ≥50 adolescents taking ART and reporting on the proportion of virological suppressed participants were included.
RESULTS: From a total of 5316 potentially relevant citations, 20 studies were included. Only eight studies reported the proportion of adolescents that were virologically suppressed at a specified time point. The proportion of adolescents with virological suppression at 12 months ranged from 27 to 89\%.
CONCLUSION: Adolescent achievement of HIV virological suppression was highly variable. Improved reporting of virological outcomes from a wider range of settings is required to support efforts to improve HIV care and treatment for adolescents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV self-testing (HIVST) has been found to be highly effective, but no cost analysis has been undertaken to guide the design of affordable and scalable implementation strategies.
METHODS: Consecutive HIV self-testers and facility-based testers were recruited from participants in a community cluster-randomised trial ( ISRCTN02004005 ) investigating the impact of offering HIVST in addition to facility-based HIV testing and counselling (HTC). Primary costing studies were undertaken of the HIVST service and of health facilities providing HTC to the trial population. Costs were adjusted to 2014 US\$ and INT\$. Recruited participants were asked about direct non-medical and indirect costs associated with accessing either modality of HIV testing, and additionally their health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D.
RESULTS: A total of 1,241 participants underwent either HIVST (n = 775) or facility-based HTC (n = 446). The mean societal cost per participant tested through HIVST (US\$9.23; 95 \% CI: US\$9.14-US\$9.32) was lower than through facility-based HTC (US\$11.84; 95 \% CI: US\$10.81-12.86). Although the mean health provider cost per participant tested through HIVST (US\$8.78) was comparable to facility-based HTC (range: US\$7.53-US\$10.57), the associated mean direct non-medical and indirect cost was lower (US\$2.93; 95 \% CI: US\$1.90-US\$3.96). The mean health provider cost per HIV positive participant identified through HIVST was higher (US\$97.50) than for health facilities (range: US\$25.18-US\$76.14), as was the mean cost per HIV positive individual assessed for anti-retroviral treatment (ART) eligibility and the mean cost per HIV positive individual initiated onto ART. In comparison to the facility-testing group, the adjusted mean EQ-5D utility score was 0.046 (95 \% CI: 0.022-0.070) higher in the HIVST group.
CONCLUSIONS: HIVST reduces the economic burden on clients, but is a costlier strategy for the health provider aiming to identify HIV positive individuals for treatment. The provider cost of HIVST could be substantially lower under less restrictive distribution models, or if costs of oral fluid HIV test kits become comparable to finger-prick kits used in health facilities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Post-tuberculosis lung damage (PTLD) is a recognised consequence of pulmonary TB (pTB). However, little is known about its prevalence, patterns and associated outcomes, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and HIV-positive adults.
METHODS: Adult (≥15 years) survivors of a first episode of pTB in Blantyre, Malawi, completed the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, 6-minute walk test, spirometry and high-resolution CT (HRCT) chest imaging at TB treatment completion. Symptom, spirometry, health seeking, TB-retreatment and mortality data were collected prospectively to 1 year. Risk factors for persistent symptoms, pulmonary function decline and respiratory-related health-seeking were identified through multivariable regression modelling.
RESULTS: Between February 2016 and April 2017, 405 participants were recruited. Median age was 35 years (IQR: 28 to 41), 77.3\% (313/405) had had microbiologically proven pTB, and 60.3\% (244/403) were HIV-positive. At pTB treatment completion, 60.7\% (246/405) reported respiratory symptoms, 34.2\% (125/365) had abnormal spirometry, 44.2\% (170/385) had bronchiectasis ≥1 lobe and 9.4\% (36/385) had ≥1 destroyed lobe on HRCT imaging. At 1 year, 30.7\% (113/368) reported respiratory symptoms, 19.3\% (59/305) and 14.1\% (43/305) of patients had experienced declines in FEV1 or FVC of ≥100 mL, 16.3\% (62/380) had reported ≥1 acute respiratory event and 12.2\% (45/368) had symptoms affecting their ability to work.
CONCLUSIONS: PTLD is a common and under-recognised consequence of pTB that is disabling for patients and associated with adverse outcomes beyond pTB treatment completion. Increased efforts to prevent PTLD and guidelines for management of established disease are urgently needed. Low-cost clinical interventions to improve patient outcomes must be evaluated.},

METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between February 2006 and July 2007, a cohort study nested within a cluster-randomised trial of community-based case finding strategies for TB in Harare, Zimbabwe was undertaken. Participants who had negative sputum smears and remained symptomatic of TB were follow-up for one year with standardised investigations including HIV testing, repeat sputum smears, TB culture and chest radiography. Defaulters were actively traced to the community. The objectives were to investigate the incidence and risk factors for TB. TB was diagnosed in 218 (18.2\%) participants, of which 39.4\% was bacteriologically confirmed. Most cases (84.2\%) were diagnosed within 3 months, but TB incidence remained high thereafter (111.3 per 1000 person-years, 95\% CI: 86.6 to 146.3). HIV prevalence was 63.3\%, and HIV-infected individuals had a 3.5-fold higher risk of tuberculosis than HIV-negative individuals.
CONCLUSION: We found that diagnosis of TB was insensitive and slow, even with early radiography and culture. Until more sensitive and rapid diagnostic tests become widely available, a much more proactive and integrated approach towards prompt initiation of ART, ideally from within TB clinics and without waiting for TB to be excluded, is needed to minimise the risk and consequences of diagnostic delay.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To understand reasons for suboptimal and delayed uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) by describing the patterns of HIV testing and counselling (HTC) and outcomes of ART eligibility assessments in primary clinic attendees.
METHODS: All clinic attendances and episodes of HTC were recorded at two clinics in Blantyre. A cohort of newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults ({\textgreater}15 years) was recruited and exit interviews undertaken. Logistic regression models were constructed to investigate factors associated with referral to start ART. Qualitative interviews were conducted with providers and patients.
RESULTS: There were 2398 episodes of HTC during 18,021 clinic attendances (13.3\%) between January and April 2011. The proportion of clinic attendees undergoing HTC was lowest in non-pregnant women (6.3\%) and men (8.5\%), compared with pregnant women (47.2\%). Men had more advanced HIV infection than women (79.7\% WHO stage 3 or 4 vs. 56.4\%). Problems with WHO staging and access to CD4 counts affected ART eligibility assessments; only 48\% completed ART eligibility assessment, and 54\% of those reporting WHO stage 3/4 illnesses were not referred to start ART promptly. On multivariate analysis, HIV-positive pregnant women were significantly less likely to be referred directly for ART initiation (adjusted OR: 0.29, 95\% CI: 0.13-0.63).
CONCLUSIONS: These data show that provider-initiated testing and counselling (PITC) has not yet been fully implemented at primary care clinics. Suboptimal ART eligibility assessments and referral (reflecting the difficulties of WHO staging in primary care) mean that simplified eligibility assessment tools are required to reduce unnecessary delay and attrition in the pre-ART period. Simplified initiation criteria for pregnant women, as being introduced in Malawi, should improve linkage to ART.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poor rates of linkage from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation are a major barrier to universal coverage of ART in sub-Saharan Africa, with reasons for failure poorly understood. In the first study of this kind at primary care level, we investigated the pathway to care in the Malawian National Programme, one of the strongest in Africa.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective cohort study was undertaken at two primary care clinics in Blantyre, Malawi. Newly diagnosed HIV-positive adults ({\textgreater}15 years) were followed for 6-months to assess completion of eligibility assessments, initiation of ART and death. Two hundred and eighty participants were followed for 82.6 patient-years. ART eligibility assessments were problematic: only 134 (47.9\%) received same day WHO staging and 121 (53.2\%) completed assessments by 6-months. Completion of CD4 measurement (stage 1/2 only) was 81/153 (52.9\%). By 6-months, 87/280 (31.1\%) had initiated ART with higher uptake in participants who were ART eligible (68/91, 74.7\%), and among participants who received same-day staging (52/134 [38.8\%] vs. 35/146 [24.0\%] p = 0.007). Non-completion of ART eligibility assessments (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.11, 95\% CI: 0.06-0.21) was associated with failure to initiate ART. Retention in pre-ART care for non-ART initiators was low (55/193 [28.5\%]). Of the 15 (5.4\%) deaths, 11 (73.3\%) occurred after ART initiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Although uptake of ART was high and prompt for patients with known eligibility, there was frequent failure to complete eligibility assessment and poor retention in pre-ART care. HIV care programmes should urgently evaluate the way patients are linked to ART. In particular, there is a critical need for simplified, same-day ART eligibility assessments, reduced requirements for hospital visits, and active defaulter follow-up.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Linkage from HIV testing and counselling (HTC) to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is suboptimal in many national programmes in sub-Saharan Africa, leading to delayed initiation of ART and increased risk of death. Reasons for failure of linkage are poorly understood.
METHODS: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with health providers and HIV-positive primary care patients as part of a prospective cohort study at primary health centres in Blantyre, Malawi. Patients successful and unsuccessful in linking to ART were included.
RESULTS: Progression through the HIV care pathway was strongly influenced by socio-cultural norms, particularly around the perceived need to regain respect lost during a period of visibly declining health. Capacity to call upon the support of networks of families, friends and employers was a key determinant of successful progression. Over-busy clinics, non-functioning laboratories and unsuitable tools used for ART eligibility assessment (WHO clinical staging system and centralized CD4 count measurement) were important health systems determinants of drop-out.
CONCLUSIONS: Key interventions that could rapidly improve linkage include guarantee of same-day, same-clinic ART eligibility assessments; utilization of the support offered by peer-groups and community health workers; and integration of HTC and ART programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Current tuberculosis diagnostics lack sensitivity, and are expensive. Highly accurate, rapid and cheaper diagnostic tests are required for point of care use in low resource settings with high HIV prevalence.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the sensitivity and specificity, and cost of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for tuberculosis diagnosis in adults with chronic cough compared to Xpert® MTB/RIF, fluorescence smear microscopy.
METHODS: Between October 2013 and March 2014, consecutive adults at a primary care clinic were screened for cough, offered HIV testing and assessed for tuberculosis using LAMP, Xpert® MTB/RIF and fluorescence smear microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity (with culture as reference standard), and costs were estimated.
RESULTS: Of 273 adults recruited, 44.3\% (121/273) were HIV-positive and 19.4\% (53/273) had bacteriogically confirmed tuberculosis. The sensitivity of LAMP compared to culture was 65.0\% (95\% CI: 48.3\% to 79.4\%) with 100\% (95\% CI: 98.0\% to 100\%) specificity. The sensitivity of Xpert® MTB/RIF (77.5\%, 95\% CI: 61.5\% to 89.2\%) was similar to that of LAMP, p = 0.132. The sensitivity of concentrated fluorescence smear microscopy with routine double reading (87.5\%, 95\% CI: 73.2\% to 95.8\%) was higher than that of LAMP, p = 0.020. All three tests had high specificity. The lowest cost per test of LAMP was at batch size of 14 samples (US\$ 9.98); this was lower than Xpert® MTB/RIF (US\$ 13.38) but higher than fluorescence smear microscopy (US\$ 0.65).
CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of LAMP was similar to Xpert® MTB/RIF but lower than fluorescence smear microscopy; all three tests had high specificity. These findings support the Malawi policy that recommends a combination of fluorescence smear microscopy and Xpert® MTB/RIF prioritised for people living with HIV, already found to be smear-negative, or being considered for retreatment of tuberculosis.},

This study set out to validate a map book system for use in urban slums with no municipal address systems, where classification has been shown to be inaccurate when address descriptions were used. Between April and July 2011, 28 noncontiguous clusters were demarcated in Blantyre, Malawi. In December 2011, antiretroviral therapy initiators were asked to identify themselves as cluster residents (yes/no and which cluster) by using map books. A random sample of antiretroviral therapy initiators was used to validate map book categorization against Global Positioning System coordinates taken from participants' households. Of the 202 antiretroviral therapy initiators, 48 (23.8\%) were categorized with the map book system as in-cluster residents and 147 (72.8\%) as out-of-cluster residents, and 7 (3.4\%) were unsure. Agreement between map books and the Global Positioning System was 100\% in the 20 adults selected for validation and was 95.0\% (κ = 0.96, 95\% confidence interval: 0.84, 1.00) in an additional 20 in-cluster residents (overall κ = 0.97, 95\% confidence interval: 0.90, 1.00). With map books, cluster residents were classified rapidly and accurately. If validated elsewhere, this approach could be of widespread value in that it would enable accurate categorization without home visits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Liverpool, injecting drug users (IDUs), men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) and UK Africans experience a disproportionate burden of HIV, yet services do not reach out to these groups and late presentations continue. We set out to: increase testing uptake in targeted marginalized groups through a community and genitourinary medicine (GUM)-based point of care testing (POCT) programme; and conduct a process evaluation to examine service provider inputs and document service user perceptions of the programme.
METHODS: Mixed quantitative, qualitative and process evaluation methods were used. Service providers were trained to use fourth generation rapid antibody/antigen HIV tests. Existing outreach services incorporated POCT into routine practice. Clients completed a semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with service providers.
RESULTS: Between September 2009 and June 2010, 953 individuals underwent POCT (GUM: 556 [59\%]; community-based sites: 397 [42\%]). Participants in the community were more likely to be male (p = 0.028), older (p {\textless} 0.001), of UK African origin (p {\textless} 0.001) and IDUs (p {\textless} 0.001) than participants from the GUM clinic. Seventeen new HIV diagnoses were confirmed (prevalence = 1.8\%), 16 of whom were in risk exposure categories (prevalence: 16/517, 3.1\%). Questionnaires and FGDs showed that clients and service providers were supportive of POCT, highlighting benefits of reaching out to marginalised communities and incorporating HIV prevention messages.
CONCLUSIONS: Community and GUM clinic-based POCT for HIV was feasible and acceptable to clients and service providers in a low prevalence setting. It successfully reached target groups, many of whom would not have otherwise tested. We recommend POCT be considered among strategies to increase the uptake of HIV testing among groups who are currently underserved.},

Fourth generation antigen/antibody rapid test kits could facilitate earlier diagnosis of HIV in non-clinical settings but lack data on performance under programmatic conditions.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated the performance of Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo Test (Determine Combo), a rapid test with indicators for both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen, in participants recruited from community outreach and hospital-based sexual health clinics. HIV infection was confirmed using laboratory enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA), Line Immuno Assay (LIA) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In total, 953 people underwent HIV testing. HIV antibody (Ab) prevalence was 1.8\% (17/953). Four false positive rapid tests were identified: two antibody and two p24 antigen (Ag) reactions. Of participants diagnosed as HIV Ab positive, 2/17 (12\%) were recent seroconverters based on clinical history and HIV antibody avidity test results. However, none of these were detected by the p24 antigen component of the rapid test kit. There were no other true positive p24 Ag tests.
CONCLUSION: These data lend support to an increasing body of evidence suggesting that 4th generation rapid HIV tests have little additional benefit over 3rd generation HIV kits for routine screening in low prevalence settings and have high rates of false positives. In order to optimally combine community-based case-finding among hard-to-reach groups with reliable and early diagnosis 3rd generation kits should be primarily used with laboratory testing of individuals thought to be at risk of acute HIV infection. A more reliable point of care diagnostic is required for the accurate detection of acute HIV infection under programmatic conditions.},

Literature on the clinical effects of DIR has not been systematically evaluated. We aimed to summarise the risk of mortality, AIDS and serious non-AIDS events associated with DIR with a systematic review.
METHODS: The protocol is registered with the Centre for Review Dissemination, University of York (registration number CRD42014010821). Included studies investigated the effect of DIR on mortality, AIDS, or serious non-AIDS events in cohort studies or cohorts contained in arms of randomised controlled trials for adults aged 16 years or older. DIR was classified as a suboptimal CD4 count (as defined by the study) despite virological suppression following at least 6 months of ART. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to December 2015. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in cohort studies. Two authors applied inclusion criteria and one author extracted data. Risk ratios were calculated for each clinical outcome reported.
RESULTS: Of 20 studies that met the inclusion criteria, 14 different definitions of DIR were used. Risk ratios for mortality in patients with and without DIR ranged between 1.00 (95\% CI 0.26 to 3.92) and 4.29 (95\% CI 1.96 to 9.38) with the majority of studies reporting a 2 to 3 fold increase in risk.
CONCLUSIONS: DIR is associated with a marked increase in mortality in most studies but definitions vary widely. We propose a standardised definition to aid the development of management options for DIR.},

We assessed the extent of stigmatising attitudes expressed by participants offered community-based HTC, and their anticipated stigma from others to assess relationship with HIV test uptake. From these data, we constructed a brief stigma scale for use around the time of HIV testing.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult members of 60 households in urban Blantyre, Malawi, were selected using population-weighted random cluster sampling and offered HTC with the option to self-test before confirmatory HTC. Prior to HTC a 15-item HIV stigma questionnaire was administered. We used association testing and principal components analysis (PCA) to construct a scale measure of stigma. Of 226 adults invited to participate, 216 (95.6\%) completed questionnaires and 198/216 (91.7\%) opted to undergo HTC (all self-tested). Stigmatising attitudes were uncommon, but anticipated stigma was common, especially fearing verbal abuse (22\%) or being abandoned by their partner (11\%). Three questions showed little association or consistency with the remaining 12 stigma questions and were not included in the final scale. For the 12-question final scale, Cronbach's alpha was 0.75. Level of stigma was not associated with previously having tested for HIV (p = 0.318) or agreeing to HTC (p = 0.379), but was associated with expressed worry about being or becoming HIV infected (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Anticipated stigma prior to HTC was common among both men and women. However, the high uptake of HTC suggests that this did not translate into reluctance to accept community-based testing. We constructed a brief scale to measure stigma at the time of HIV testing that could rapidly identify individuals requiring additional support following diagnosis and monitor the impact of increasing availability of community-based HTC on prevalence of stigma.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that HIV-positive adults with CD4 count ≤500 cells/mm(3) initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART). In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, CD4 count is not widely available or consistently used and instead the WHO clinical staging system is used to determine ART eligibility. However, concerns have been raised regarding its discriminatory ability to identify patients eligible to start ART. We therefore reviewed the accuracy of WHO stage 3 or 4 assessment in identifying ART eligibility according to CD4 count thresholds for ART initiation.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and Global Health databases and conference abstracts using a comprehensive strategy for studies that compared the results of WHO clinical staging with CD4 count thresholds. Studies performed in sub-Saharan Africa and published in English between 1998 and 2013 were eligible for inclusion according to our predefined study protocol. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality and risk of bias using the Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were derived for each CD4 count threshold and hierarchical summary receiver operator characteristic curves were plotted.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria, including 25,032 participants from 14 countries. Most studies assessed individuals attending ART clinics prior to treatment initiation. WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 disease had a sensitivity of 60\% (95\% CI: 45-73\%, Q=914.26, p{\textless}0.001) and specificity of 73\% (95\% CI: 60-83\%, Q=1439.43, p{\textless}0.001) for a CD4 threshold of ≤200 cells/mm(3) (11 studies); sensitivity and specificity for a threshold of CD4 count ≤350 cells/mm(3) were 45\% (95\% CI: 26-66\%, Q=1607.31, p{\textless}0.001) and 85\% (95\% CI: 69-93\%, Q=896.70, p{\textless}0.001), respectively (six studies). For the threshold of CD4 count ≤500 cells/mm(3) sensitivity was 14\% (95\% CI: 13-15\%) and specificity was 95\% (95\% CI: 94-96\%) (one study).
CONCLUSIONS: When used for individual treatment decisions, WHO clinical staging misses a high proportion of individuals who are ART eligible by CD4 count, with sensitivity falling as CD4 count criteria rises. Access to accurate, accessible, robust and affordable CD4 count testing methods will be a pressing need for as long as ART initiation decisions are based on criteria other than seropositivity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There was a large outbreak of measles in Liverpool, UK, in 2012-2013, despite measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation uptake rates that were higher than the national average. We estimated measles susceptibility of a cohort of children born in Liverpool between 1995 and 2012 to understand whether there was a change in susceptibility before and after the outbreak and to inform vaccination strategy.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: The city of Liverpool, North West UK.
PARTICIPANTS: All children born in Liverpool (72 101) between 1995 and 2012 inclusive who were identified using the Child Health Information System (CHIS) and were still resident within Liverpool in 2014.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated cohort age-disaggregated and neighbourhood-disaggregated measles susceptibility according to WHO thresholds before and after the outbreak for children aged 1-17 years.
RESULTS: Susceptibility to measles was above WHO elimination thresholds before and after the measles outbreak in the 10+ age group. The proportion of children susceptible before and after outbreak, respectively: age 1-4 years 15.0\% before and 14.9\% after; age 5-9 years 9.9\% before and 7.7\% after; age 10+ years 8.6\% before and 8.5\% after. Despite an intensive MMR immunisation catch-up campaign after the 2012-2013 measles outbreak, the overall proportion of children with no MMR remains high at 6.1\% (4390/72 351). Across all age groups and before and after the outbreak, measles susceptibility was clustered by neighbourhood, with deprived areas having the greatest proportion of susceptible children.
CONCLUSIONS: The risk of sustained measles outbreaks remains, especially as large pools of susceptible older children will start leaving secondary education and continue to aggregate in higher education, employment and other community settings and institutions resulting in the potential for a propagated measles outbreak.},

	abstract = {Background: Human immunodeficiency virus self-testing (HIVST) is effective, with scale-up underway in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed cost-effectiveness of adding HIVST to existing facility-based HIV testing and counseling (HTC) services. Both 2010 (initiate at CD4 {\textless}350 cells/μL) and 2015 (initiate all) World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for antiretroviral treatment (ART) were considered.
Methods: A microsimulation model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness, from both health provider and societal perspectives, of an HIVST service implemented in a cluster-randomized trial (CRT; ISRCTN02004005) in Malawi. Costs and health outcomes were evaluated over a 20-year time horizon, using a discount rate of 3\%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for parameter uncertainty.
Results: From the health provider perspective and 20-year time horizon, facility HTC using 2010 WHO ART guidelines was the least costly (\$294.71 per person; 95\% credible interval [CrI], 270.79-318.45) and least effective (11.64 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] per person; 95\% CrI, 11.43-11.86) strategy. Compared with this strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for facility HTC using 2015 WHO ART guidelines was \$226.85 (95\% CrI, 198.79-284.35) per QALY gained. The strategy of facility HTC plus HIVST, using 2010 WHO ART guidelines, was extendedly dominated. The ICER for facility HTC plus HIVST, using 2015 WHO ART guidelines, was \$253.90 (95\% CrI, 201.71-342.02) per QALY gained compared with facility HTC and using 2015 WHO ART guidelines.
Conclusions: HIVST may be cost-effective in a Malawian population with high HIV prevalence. HIVST is suited to an early HIV diagnosis and treatment strategy.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of storing commonly used rapid diagnostic tests above manufacturer-recommended temperature (at 37°C), and the accuracy of delayed reading of oral fluid kits with relevance to HIV self-testing programmes.
DESIGN: A quality assurance study of OraQuick (OraSure), Determine HIV 1/2™ (Alere) and Uni-Gold™ (Recombigen®).
METHODS: Consecutive adults (≥18y) attending Ndirande Health Centre in urban Blantyre, Malawi in January to April 2012 underwent HIV testing with two of each of the three rapid diagnostic test kits stored for 28 days at either 18°C (optimally-stored) or at 37°C (pre-incubated). Used OraQuick test kits were stored in a laboratory for delayed day 1 and subsequent monthly re-reading was undertaken for one year.
RESULTS: Of 378 individuals who underwent parallel testing, 5 (1.3\%) were dropped from the final analysis due to discordant or missing reference standard results (optimally-stored Determine and Uni-Gold). Compared to the diagnostic reference standard, OraQuick had a sensitivity of 97.2\% (95\% CI: 93.6-99.6). There were 7 false negative results among all test kits stored at 37°C and three false negatives among optimally stored kits. Excellent agreement between pre-incubated tests and optimally-stored tests with Kappa values of 1.00 for Determine and Uni-Gold; and 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.95; 1.00) for OraQuick were observed. There was high visual stability on re-reading of OraQuick, with only 1/375 pre-incubated and 1/371 optimally-stored OraQuick kits changing from the initial result over 12 months.
CONCLUSION: Erroneous results observed during HIV testing in low income settings are likely to be due to factors other than suboptimal storage conditions. Re-reading returned OraQuick kits may offer a convenient and accurate quality assurance approach, including in HIV self-testing programmes.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: HIV and tuberculosis (TB) remain leading causes of preventable death in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends HIV testing for all individuals with TB symptoms, but implementation has been suboptimal. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analyses to estimate HIV and TB prevalence, and short-term (two to six months) mortality, among adults with TB symptoms at community- and facility level.
METHODS: We searched Embase, Global Health and MEDLINE databases, and reviewed conference abstracts for studies reporting simultaneous HIV and TB screening of adults in LMICs published between January 2003 and December 2017. Meta-analyses were performed to estimate prevalence of HIV, undiagnosed TB and mortality risk at different health system levels.
RESULTS: Sixty-two studies including 260,792 symptomatic adults were identified, mostly from Africa and Asia. Median HIV prevalence was 19.2\% (IQR: 8.3\% to 40.4\%) at community level, 55.7\% (IQR: 20.9\% to 71.2\%) at primary care level and 80.7\% (IQR: 73.8\% to 84.6\%) at hospital level. Median TB prevalence was 6.9\% (IQR: 3.3\% to 8.4\%) at community, 20.5\% (IQR: 11.7\% to 46.4\%) at primary care and 36.4\% (IQR: 22.9\% to 40.9\%) at hospital level. Median short-term mortality was 22.6\% (IQR: 15.6\% to 27.7\%) among inpatients, 3.1\% (IQR: 1.2\% to 4.2\%) at primary care and 1.6\% (95\% CI: 0.45 to 4.13, n = 1 study) at community level.
CONCLUSIONS: Adults with TB symptoms have extremely high prevalence of HIV infection, even when identified through community surveys. TB prevalence and mortality increased substantially at primary care and inpatient level respectively. Strategies to expand symptom-based TB screening combined with HIV and TB testing for all symptomatic individuals should be of the highest priority for both disease programmes in LMICs with generalized HIV epidemics. Interventions to reduce short-term mortality are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Background
              The prevalence of diseases other than TB detected during chest X-ray (CXR) screening is unknown in sub-Saharan Africa. This represents a missed opportunity for identification and treatment of potentially significant disease. Our aim was to describe and quantify non-TB abnormalities identified by TB-focused CXR screening during the 2016 Kenya National TB Prevalence Survey.
            
            
              Methods
              We reviewed a random sample of 1140 adult (≥15 years) CXRs classified as ‘abnormal, suggestive of TB’ or ‘abnormal other’ during field interpretation from the TB prevalence survey. Each image was read (blinded to field classification and study radiologist read) by two expert radiologists, with images classified into one of four major anatomical categories and primary radiological findings. A third reader resolved discrepancies. Prevalence and 95\% CIs of abnormalities diagnosis were estimated.
            
            
              Findings
              Cardiomegaly was the most common non-TB abnormality at 259 out of 1123 (23.1\%, 95\% CI 20.6\% to 25.6\%), while cardiomegaly with features of cardiac failure occurred in 17 out of 1123 (1.5\%, 95\% CI 0.9\% to 2.4\%). We also identified chronic pulmonary pathology including suspected COPD in 3.2\% (95\% CI 2.3\% to 4.4\%) and non-specific patterns in 4.6\% (95\% CI 3.5\% to 6.0\%). Prevalence of active-TB and severe post-TB lung changes was 3.6\% (95\% CI 2.6\% to 4.8\%) and 1.4\% (95\% CI 0.8\% to 2.3\%), respectively.
            
            
              Interpretation
              Based on radiological findings, we identified a wide variety of non-TB abnormalities during population-based TB screening. TB prevalence surveys and active case finding activities using mass CXR offer an opportunity to integrate disease screening efforts.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many southern African countries are nearing the global goal of diagnosing 90\% of people with HIV by 2020. In 2016, 84 and 86\% of people with HIV knew their status in Malawi and Zimbabwe, respectively. However, gaps remain, particularly among men. We investigated awareness and use of, and willingness to self-test for HIV and explored sociodemographic associations before large-scale implementation.
METHODS: We pooled responses from two of the first cross-sectional Demographic and Health Surveys to include HIV self-testing (HIVST) questions in Malawi and Zimbabwe in 2015-16. We investigated sociodemographic factors and sexual risk behaviours associated with previously testing for HIV, and past use, awareness of, and future willingness to self-test using univariable and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for the sample design and limiting analysis to participants with a completed questionnaire and valid HIV test result. We restricted analysis of willingness to self-test to Zimbabwean men, as women and Malawians were not systematically asked this question.
RESULTS: Of 31,385 individuals, 31.2\% of men had never tested compared with 16.5\% of women (p {\textless} 0.001). For men, the likelihood of having ever tested increased with age. Past use and awareness of HIVST was very low, 1.2 and 12.6\%, respectively. Awareness was lower among women than men (9.1\% vs 15.3\%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.55; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-1.75), and at younger ages, and lower education and literacy levels. Willingness to self-test among Zimbabwean men was high (84.5\%), with greater willingness associated with having previously tested for HIV, being at high sexual risk (highest willingness [aOR = 3.74; 95\%CI: 1.39-10.03, p {\textless} 0.009]), and being ≥25 years old. Wealthier men had greater awareness of HIVST than poorer men (p {\textless} 0.001). The highest willingness to self-test (aOR = 3.74; 95\%CI: 1.39-10.03, p {\textless} 0.009) was among men at high HIV-related sexual risk.
CONCLUSIONS: In 2015-16, many Malawian and Zimbabwean men had never tested for HIV. Despite low awareness and minimal HIVST experience, willingness to self-test was high among Zimbabwean men, especially older men with moderate-to-high HIV-related sexual risk. These data provide a valuable baseline against which to investigate population-level uptake of HIVST as programmes scale up. Programmes introducing, or planning to introduce, HIVST should consider including relevant questions in population-based surveys.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Household contact tracing of index TB cases has been advocated as a key part of TB control for many years, but has not been widely implemented in many low-resource setting because of the current dearth of high quality evidence for effectiveness. Innovative strategies for earlier, more effective treatment are particularly important in contexts with hyper-endemic levels of HIV, where levels of TB infection remain extremely high.
METHODS: We present the design of a household cluster-randomised controlled trial of interventions aimed at improving TB-free survival and reducing childhood prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among household contacts of index TB cases diagnosed in two provinces of South Africa. Households of index TB cases will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either an intensified home screening and linkage for TB and HIV intervention, or enhanced standard of care. The primary outcome will compare between groups the TB-free survival of household contacts over 15 months. All participants, or their next-of-kin, will provide written informed consent to participate.
DISCUSSION: Evidence from randomised trials is required to identify cost-effective approaches to TB case-finding that can be applied at scale in sub-Saharan Africa.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The scale-up of HIV self-testing (HIVST) in Africa is recommended, but little is known about how this novel approach influences economic outcomes following subsequent antiretroviral treatment (ART) compared with established facility-based HIV testing and counseling (HTC) approaches.
SETTING: HIV clinics in Blantyre, Malawi.
METHODS: Consecutive HIV-positive participants, diagnosed by HIVST or facility-based HTC as part of a community cluster-randomized trial (ISRCTN02004005), were followed from initial assessment for ART until 1-year postinitiation. Healthcare resource use was prospectively measured, and primary costing studies undertaken to estimate total health provider costs. Participants were interviewed to establish direct nonmedical and indirect costs over the first year of ART. Costs were adjusted to 2014 US\$ and INT\$. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D at each clinic visit. Multivariable analyses estimated predictors of economic outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 325 participants attending HIV clinics for assessment for ART, 265 were identified through facility-based HTC, and 60 through HIVST; 168/265 (69.2\%) and 36/60 (60.0\%), respectively, met national ART eligibility criteria and initiated treatment. The mean total health provider assessment costs for ART initiation were US\$22.79 (SE: 0.56) and US\$19.92 (SE: 0.77) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively, and was US\$2.87 (bootstrap 95\% CI: US\$1.01 to US\$4.73) lower for the HIVST group. The mean total health provider costs for the first year of ART were US\$168.65 (SE: 2.02) and US\$164.66 (SE: 4.21) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively, and comparable between the 2 groups (bootstrap 95\% CI: -US\$12.38 to US\$4.39). EQ-5D utility scores immediately before and one year after ART initiation were comparable between the 2 groups. EQ-5D utility scores 1 year after ART initiation had increased by 0.129 (SE: 0.011) and 0.139 (SE: 0.027) for facility-based HTC and HIVST participants, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Once HIV self-testers are linked into HIV services, their economic outcomes are comparable to those linking to services after facility-based HTC.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Patients with tuberculosis (TB) symptoms have high prevalence of HIV, and should be prioritised for HIV testing.
METHODS: In a prospective cohort study in Bangwe primary care clinic, Blantyre, Malawi, all adults (18 years or older) presenting with an acute illness were screened for TB symptoms (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss). Demographic characteristics were linked to exit interview by fingerprint bioidentification. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to estimate the proportion completing same-visit HIV testing, comparing between those with and without TB symptoms.
RESULTS: There were 5427 adult attendees between 21/5/2018 and 6/9/2018. Exit interviews were performed for 2402 (44\%). 276 patients were excluded from the analysis, being already on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Presentation with any TB symptom was common for men (54.6\%) and women (57.4\%). Overall 27.6\% (585/ 2121) attenders reported being offered testing and 21.5\% (455/2121) completed provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) and received results. The proportions offered testing were similar among participants with and without TB symptoms (any TB symptom: 29.0\% vs. 25.7\%). This was consistent for each individual symptom; cough, weight loss, fever and night sweats. Multivariable regression models indicated men, younger adults and participants who had previously tested were more likely to complete PITC than women, older adults and those who had never previously tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Same-visit completion of HIV testing was suboptimal, especially among groups known to have high prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. As countries approach universal coverage of ART, identifying and prioritising currently underserved groups for HIV testing will be essential.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Household contacts of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) often have latent TB infection, and are at risk of progression to disease. We set out to investigate whether index TB case HIV status was linked to a higher probability of latent TB infection among household contacts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from participants in the intervention arm of a household cluster-randomised trial in two South Africa provinces (Mangaung, Free State, and Capricorn, Limpopo). In intervention group households, TB contacts underwent HIV testing and tuberculin skin testing (TST). TST induration was estimated at two cut-offs (≥5mm, ≥10mm). Multilevel Bayesian regression models estimated posterior distributions of the percentage of household contacts with TST induration ≥5mm and ≥10mm by age group, and compared the odds of latent TB infection by key risk factors including HIV status index case age and study province.
RESULTS: A total of 2,985 household contacts of 924 index cases were assessed, with most 2,725 (91.3\%) undergoing TST. HIV prevalence in household contacts was 14\% and 10\% in Mangaung and Capricorn respectively. Overall, 16.8\% (458/2,725) had TST induration of ≥5mm and 13.1\% (359/2,725) ≥10mm. In Mangaung, children aged 0-4 years had a high TST positivity prevalence compared to their peers in Capricorn (22.0\% vs. 7.6\%, and 20.5\% vs. 2.3\%, using TST thresholds of ≥5mm and ≥10mm respectively). Compared to contacts from Capricorn, household contacts living in Mangaung were more likely to have TST induration ≥5mm (odds ratio [OR]: 3.08, 95\% credibility interval [CI]: 2.13-4.58) and ≥10mm (OR: 4.52, 95\% CI: 3.03-6.97). There was a 90\% and 92\% posterior probability that the odds of TST induration ≥5mm (OR: 0.79, 95\% CI: 0.56-1.14) and ≥10mm (OR: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.53-1.10) respectively were lower in household contacts of HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative index cases.
CONCLUSIONS: High TST induration positivity, especially among young children and people living in Mangaung indicates considerable TB transmission despite high antiretroviral therapy coverage. Household contact of HIV-positive index TB cases were less likely to have evidence of latent TB infection than contacts of HIV-negative index cases.},

	abstract = {Community-based active case-finding (ACF) may have important impacts on routine TB case-detection and subsequent patient-initiated diagnosis pathways, contributing “indirectly” to infectious diseases prevention and care. We investigated the impact of ACF beyond directly diagnosed patients for TB, using routine case-notification rate (CNR) ratios as a measure of indirect effect. We systematically searched for publications 01-Jan-1980 to 13-Apr-2020 reporting on community-based ACF interventions compared to a comparison group, together with review of linked manuscripts reporting knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) outcomes or qualitative data on TB testing behaviour. We calculated CNR ratios of routine case-notifications (i.e. excluding cases identified directly through ACF) and compared proxy behavioural outcomes for both ACF and comparator communities. Full text manuscripts from 988 of 23,883 abstracts were screened for inclusion; 36 were eligible. Of these, 12 reported routine notification rates separately from ACF intervention-attributed rates, and one reported any proxy behavioural outcomes. Two further studies were identified from screening 1121 abstracts for linked KAP/qualitative manuscripts. 8/12 case-notification studies were considered at critical or serious risk of bias. 8/11 non-randomised studies reported bacteriologically-confirmed CNR ratios between 0.47 (95\% CI:0.41–0.53) and 0.96 (95\% CI:0.94–0.97), with 7/11 reporting all-form CNR ratios between 0.96 (95\% CI:0.88–1.05) and 1.09 (95\% CI:1.02–1.16). One high-quality randomised-controlled trial reported a ratio of 1.14 (95\% CI 0.91–1.43). KAP/qualitative manuscripts provided insufficient evidence to establish the impact of ACF on subsequent TB testing behaviour. ACF interventions with routine CNR ratios {\textgreater}1 suggest an indirect effect on wider TB case-detection, potentially due to impact on subsequent TB testing behaviour through follow-up after a negative ACF test or increased TB knowledge. However, data on this type of impact are rarely collected. Evaluation of routine case-notification, testing and proxy behavioural outcomes in intervention and comparator communities should be included as standard methodology in future ACF campaign study designs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suboptimal tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics and HIV contribute to the high global burden of TB. We investigated costs and yield from systematic HIV-TB screening, including computer-aided digital chest X-ray (DCXR-CAD).
METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this open, three-arm randomised trial, adults (≥18 years) with cough attending acute primary services in Malawi were randomised (1:1:1) to standard of care (SOC); oral HIV testing (HIV screening) and linkage to care; or HIV testing and linkage to care plus DCXR-CAD with sputum Xpert for high CAD4TBv5 scores (HIV-TB screening). Participants and study staff were not blinded to intervention allocation, but investigator blinding was maintained until final analysis. The primary outcome was time to TB treatment. Secondary outcomes included proportion with same-day TB treatment; prevalence of undiagnosed/untreated bacteriologically confirmed TB on day 56; and undiagnosed/untreated HIV. Analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Cost-effectiveness analysis used a health-provider perspective. Between 15 November 2018 and 27 November 2019, 8,236 were screened for eligibility, with 473, 492, and 497 randomly allocated to SOC, HIV, and HIV-TB screening arms; 53 (11\%), 52 (9\%), and 47 (9\%) were lost to follow-up, respectively. At 56 days, TB treatment had been started in 5 (1.1\%) SOC, 8 (1.6\%) HIV screening, and 15 (3.0\%) HIV-TB screening participants. Median (IQR) time to TB treatment was 11 (6.5 to 38), 6 (1 to 22), and 1 (0 to 3) days (hazard ratio for HIV-TB versus SOC: 2.86, 1.04 to 7.87), with same-day treatment of 0/5 (0\%) SOC, 1/8 (12.5\%) HIV, and 6/15 (40.0\%) HIV-TB screening arm TB patients (p = 0.03). At day 56, 2 SOC (0.5\%), 4 HIV (1.0\%), and 2 HIV-TB (0.5\%) participants had undiagnosed microbiologically confirmed TB. HIV screening reduced the proportion with undiagnosed or untreated HIV from 10 (2.7\%) in the SOC arm to 2 (0.5\%) in the HIV screening arm (risk ratio [RR]: 0.18, 0.04 to 0.83), and 1 (0.2\%) in the HIV-TB screening arm (RR: 0.09, 0.01 to 0.71). Incremental costs were US\$3.58 and US\$19.92 per participant screened for HIV and HIV-TB; the probability of cost-effectiveness at a US\$1,200/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold was 83.9\% and 0\%. Main limitations were the lower than anticipated prevalence of TB and short participant follow-up period; cost and quality of life benefits of this screening approach may accrue over a longer time horizon.
CONCLUSIONS: DCXR-CAD with universal HIV screening significantly increased the timeliness and completeness of HIV and TB diagnosis. If implemented at scale, this has potential to rapidly and efficiently improve TB and HIV diagnosis and treatment.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Men have a higher prevalence of undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) than women and can spend up to a year longer contributing to ongoing transmission in the community before receiving treatment. Health outcomes are often worse for patients with TB living in informal settlements especially men. This study aimed to understand the barriers preventing men from seeking care for TB and cocreate interventions to address these barriers.
METHODS: We used qualitative research methods including in-depth interviews and participatory workshops. Researchers worked with women and men living in Bangwe, an informal settlement in Blantyre, Malawi to develop interventions that reflected their lived realities. The study took place over two phases, in the first phase we undertook interviews with men and women to explore barrier to care seeking, in the second phase we used participatory workshops to cocreate interventions to address barriers and followed up on issues emerging from the workshops with further interviews. In total, 30 interviews were conducted, and 23 participants joined participatory workshops. The team used a thematic analysis to analyse the data.
RESULTS: Three interconnected thematic areas shaped men's health TB seeking behaviour: precarious socioeconomic conditions; gendered social norms; and constraints in the health system. Insecurity of day labour with no provision for sick leave; pressure to provide for the household and a gendered desire not to appear weak and a severely under-resourced health system all contributed to men delaying care in this context. Identified interventions included improved patient-provider relations within the health-system, improved workers' health rights and broader social support for households.
CONCLUSION: Improving mens' pathways to care requires interventions that consider contextual issues by addressing individual level socioeconomic factors but also broader structural factors of gendered social dynamics and health systems environment.},

	abstract = {Seasonal trends in tuberculosis (TB) notifications have been observed in several countries but are poorly understood. Explanatory factors may include weather, indoor crowding, seasonal respiratory infections and migration. Using enhanced citywide TB surveillance data collected over nine years in Blantyre, Malawi, we set out to investigate how weather and seasonality affect temporal trends in TB case notification rates (CNRs) across different demographic groups. We used data from prospective enhanced surveillance between April 2011 and December 2018, which systematically collected age, HIV status, sex and case notification dates for all registering TB cases in Blantyre. We retrieved temperature and rainfall data from the Global Surface Summary of the Day weather station database. We calculated weekly trends in TB CNRs, rainfall and temperature, and calculated 10-week moving averages. To investigate the associations between rainfall, temperature and TB CNRs, we fitted generalized linear models using a distributed lag nonlinear framework. The estimated Blantyre population increased from 1,068,151 in April 2011 to 1,264,304 in December 2018, with 15,908 TB cases recorded. Overall annual TB CNRs declined from 222 to 145 per 100,000 between 2012 and 2018, with the largest declines seen in HIV-positive people and adults aged over 20 years old. TB CNRs peaks occurred with increasing temperature in September and October before the onset of increased rainfall, and later in the rainy season during January-March, after sustained rainfall. When lag between a change in weather and TB case notifications was accounted for, higher average rainfall was associated with an equivalent six weeks of relatively lower TB notification rates, whereas there were no changes in TB CNR associated with change in average temperatures. TB CNRs in Blantyre have a seasonal pattern of two cyclical peaks per year, coinciding with the start and end of the rainy season. These trends may be explained by increased transmission at certain times of the year, by limited healthcare access, by patterns of seasonal respiratory infections precipitating cough and care-seeking, or by migratory patterns related to planting and harvesting during the rainy season.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ratios of bacteriologically positive tuberculosis (TB) prevalence to notification rates are used to characterise typical durations of TB disease. However, this ignores the clinical spectrum of tuberculosis disease and potentially long infectious periods with minimal or no symptoms prior to care-seeking.
METHODS: We developed novel statistical models to estimate progression from initial bacteriological positivity including smear conversion, symptom onset and initial care-seeking. Case-detection ratios, TB incidence, durations, and other parameters were estimated by fitting the model to tuberculosis prevalence survey and notification data (one subnational and 11 national datasets) within a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.
RESULTS: Analysis across 11 national datasets found asymptomatic tuberculosis durations in the range 4-8 months for African countries; three countries in Asia (Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Philippines) showed longer durations of {\textgreater} 1 year. For the six countries with relevant data, care-seeking typically began half-way between symptom onset and notification. For Kenya and Blantyre, Malawi, individual-level data were available. The sex-specific durations of asymptomatic bacteriologically-positive tuberculosis were 9.0 months (95\% credible interval [CrI]: 7.2-11.2) for men and 8.1 months (95\% CrI: 6.2-10.3) for women in Kenya, and 4.9 months (95\% CrI: 2.6-7.9) for men and 3.5 months (95\% CrI: 1.3-6.2) for women in Blantyre. Age-stratified analysis of data for Kenya showed no strong age-dependence in durations. For Blantyre, HIV-stratified analysis estimated an asymptomatic duration of 1.3 months (95\% CrI: 0.3-3.0) for HIV-positive people, shorter than the 8.5 months (95\% CrI: 5.0-12.7) for HIV-negative people. Additionally, case-detection ratios were higher for people living with HIV than HIV-negative people (93\% vs 71\%).
CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic TB disease typically lasts around 6 months. We found no evidence of age-dependence, but much shorter durations among people living with HIV, and longer durations in some Asian settings. To eradicate TB transmission, greater gains may be achieved by proactively screening people without symptoms through active case finding interventions.},

Using enhanced TB surveillance data, we recorded all TB treatment initiations and outcomes between 2015 and 2018. Household locations were geolocated, and distances were measured by a straight line or shortest road network. We constructed Bayesian multi-level logistic regression models to investigate associations between distance and case fatality. A total of 479/4397 (10.9\%) TB patients died. Greater distance was associated with higher (odds ratio (OR) 1.07 per kilometre (km) increase, 95\% credible interval (CI) 0.99–1.16) odds of death in TB patients registered at the referral hospital, but not among TB patients registered at primary clinics (OR 0.98 per km increase, 95\% CI 0.92–1.03). Age (OR 1.02 per year increase, 95\% CI 1.01–1.02) and HIV-positive status (OR 2.21, 95\% CI 1.73–2.85) were also associated with higher odds of death. Model estimates were similar for both distance measures. Distance was a risk factor for death among patients at the main referral hospital, likely due to delayed diagnosis and suboptimal healthcare access. To reduce mortality, targeted community TB screening interventions for TB disease and HIV, and expansion of novel sensitive diagnostic tests are required.},

	abstract = {Background: Human-to-animal transmission of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is reported in South Africa but there is a paucity of epidemiological data. The aim of this One Health manuscript is to describe zooanthroponotic exposure of domestic animals to TB patients, virtually all of whom had laboratory confirmed pulmonary Mtb disease.
Methods: This cross-sectional study was nested within two TB contact tracing studies and collected data from 2017 to 2019. TB index patients and their households in three provinces of South Africa were recruited. A questionnaire was administered to households, assessing type and number of animals owned, degree of exposure of animals to humans, and veterinary consultations. For this analysis, we compared descriptive variables by animal-keeping status (animal-keeping vs non-animal keeping households), calculated the chi square and respective p-values.
Results: We visited 1766 households with at least one confirmed case of TB, 33\% (587/1766) had livestock or companion animals. Of non-animal-owning households, 2\% (27/1161) cared for other community members' livestock. Few (16\%, 92/587) households kept animals in their dwelling overnight, while 45\% (266/587) kept animals outside the home, but within 10 m of where people slept and ate. Most (81\%, 478/587) of people in animal-owning households were willing for their animal/s to have a TB skin test, but {\textless}1\% (5/587) of animals had been skin-tested; 4\% (24/587) of animal-owning households had a veterinary consultation in the past six months, and 5\% (31/587) reported one of their animals dying from natural causes in the prior six months.
Conclusion: Our survey suggests that a high proportion of patients with TB live in settings facilitating close contact with domestic animal species with known susceptibility to Mtb. There is a substantial exposure of household animals to patients with TB and therefore risk of both transmission to, and spillback from animals to humans.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Injuries cause 30\% more deaths than HIV, TB and malaria combined, and a prospective fracture care registry was established to investigate the fracture burden and treatment in Malawi to inform evidence-based improvements.
OBJECTIVE: To use the analysis of prospectively-collected fracture data to develop evidence-based strategies to improve fracture care in Malawi and other similar settings.
DESIGN: Multicentre prospective registry study.
SETTING: Two large referral centres and two district hospitals in Malawi.
PARTICIPANTS: All patients with a fracture (confirmed by radiographs)-including patients with multiple fractures-were eligible to be included in the registry.
EXPOSURE: All fractures that presented to two urban central and two rural district hospitals in Malawi over a 3.5-year period (September 2016 to March 2020).
MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): Demographics, characteristics of injuries, and treatment outcomes were collected on all eligible participants.
RESULTS: Between September 2016 and March 2020, 23,734 patients were enrolled with a median age of 15 years (interquartile range: 10-35 years); 68.7\% were male. The most common injuries were radius/ulna fractures (n = 8,682, 36.8\%), tibia/fibula fractures (n = 4,036, 17.0\%), humerus fractures (n = 3,527, 14.9\%) and femoral fractures (n = 2,355, 9.9\%). The majority of fractures (n = 21,729, 91.6\%) were treated by orthopaedic clinical officers; 88\% (20,885/2,849) of fractures were treated non-operatively, and 62.7\% were treated and sent home on the same day. Open fractures (OR:53.19, CI:39.68-72.09), distal femoral fractures (OR:2.59, CI:1.78-3.78), patella (OR:10.31, CI:7.04-15.07), supracondylar humeral fractures (OR:3.10, CI:2.38-4.05), ankle fractures (OR:2.97, CI:2.26-3.92) and tibial plateau fractures (OR:2.08, CI:1.47-2.95) were more likely to be treated operatively compared to distal radius fractures.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The current model of fracture care in Malawi is such that trained orthopaedic surgeons manage fractures operatively in urban referral centres whereas orthopaedic clinical officers mainly manage fractures non-operatively in both district and referral centres. We recommend that orthopaedic surgeons should supervise orthopaedic clinical officers to manage non operative injuries in central and district hospitals. There is need for further studies to assess the clinical and patient reported outcomes of these fracture cases, managed both operatively and non-operatively.},

	abstract = {Introduction Over 40\% of global tuberculosis case notifications are diagnosed clinically without mycobacteriological confirmation. Standard diagnostic algorithms include ‘trial-of-antibiotics’—empirical antibiotic treatment given to mycobacteriology-negative individuals to treat infectious causes of symptoms other than tuberculosis, as a ‘rule-out’ diagnostic test for tuberculosis. Potentially 26.5 million such antibiotic courses/year are prescribed globally for the 5.3 million/year mycobacteriology-negative patients, making trial-of-antibiotics the most common tuberculosis diagnostic, and a global-scale risk for antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Our systematic review found no randomised controlled trial (RCT) to support use of trial-of-antibiotic. The RCT aims to determine the diagnostic and clinical value and AMR consequences of trial-of-antibiotics.
Methods and analysis A three-arm, open-label, RCT randomising (1:1:1) Malawian adults (≥18 years) seeking primary care for cough into: (a) azithromycin 500 mg one time per day for 3 days or (b) amoxicillin 1 g three times per day for 5 days or (c) standard-of-care (no immediate antibiotic). We will perform mycobacteriology tests (microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF (Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampicin) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis culture) at baseline. We will use audiocomputer-assisted self-interview to assess clinical improvement at day 8. First primary outcome will be proportion of patients reporting day 8 improvement out of those with negative mycobacteriology (specificity). Second primary outcome will be day 29 incidence of a composite endpoint of either death or hospitalisation or missed tuberculosis diagnosis. To determine AMR impact we compare proportion of resistant nasopharyngeal Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates on day 29. 400 mycobacteriology-negative participants/arm will be required to detect a ≥10\% absolute difference in diagnostic specificity with 80\% power. We will estimate measures of effect by comparing outcomes in antibiotic arms (combined and individually) to standard-of-care.
Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed and approved by Malawi College of Medicine Research and Ethics Committee, London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) Research Ethics Committee and Regional Committee for Health and Research Ethics – Norway, and Malawi Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board. We will present abstracts at relevant conferences, and prepare a manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: As infectious diseases approach global elimination targets, spatial targeting is increasingly important to identify community hotspots of transmission and effectively target interventions. We aimed to synthesise relevant evidence to define best practice approaches and identify policy and research gaps.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically appraise evidence for the effectiveness of spatially targeted community public health interventions for HIV, tuberculosis (TB), leprosy and malaria.
DESIGN: Systematic review.
DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, Embase, Global Health, Web of Science and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews between 1 January 1993 and 22 March 2021.
STUDY SELECTION: The studies had to include HIV or TB or leprosy or malaria and spatial hotspot definition, and community interventions.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A data extraction tool was used. For each study, we summarised approaches to identifying hotpots, intervention design and effectiveness of the intervention.
RESULTS: Ten studies, including one cluster randomised trial and nine with alternative designs (before-after, comparator area), satisfied our inclusion criteria. Spatially targeted interventions for HIV (one USA study), TB (three USA) and leprosy (two Brazil, one Federated States of Micronesia) each used household location and disease density to define hotspots followed by community-based screening. Malaria studies (one each from India, Indonesia and Kenya) used household location and disease density for hotspot identification followed by complex interventions typically combining community screening, larviciding of stagnant water bodies, indoor residual spraying and mass drug administration. Evidence of effect was mixed.
CONCLUSIONS: Studies investigating spatially targeted interventions were few in number, and mostly underpowered or otherwise limited methodologically, affecting interpretation of intervention impact. Applying advanced epidemiological methodologies supporting more robust hotspot identification and larger or more intensive interventions would strengthen the evidence-base for this increasingly important approach.

We assessed whether earlier ART improved outcomes in people with newly diagnosed HIV and tuberculosis.
METHODS: We did a systematic review by searching nine databases for trials that compared earlier ART to later ART initiation in people with HIV and tuberculosis. We included studies published from database inception to 12 March 2021. We compared ART within four weeks versus ART more than four weeks after TB treatment, and ART within two weeks versus ART between two and eight weeks, and stratified analysis by CD4 count. The main outcome was death; secondary outcomes included IRIS and AIDS-defining events. We pooled effect estimates using random effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We screened 2468 abstracts, and identified nine trials. Among people with all CD4 counts, there was no difference in mortality by earlier ART (≤4 week) versus later ART ({\textgreater}4 week) (risk difference [RD] 0\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -2\% to +1\%). Among people with CD4 count ≤50 cells/mm3 , earlier ART (≤4 weeks) reduced risk of death (RD -6\%, -10\% to -1\%). Among people with all CD4 counts earlier ART (≤4 weeks) increased the risk of IRIS (RD +6\%, 95\% CI +2\% to +10\%) and reduced the incidence of AIDS-defining events (RD -2\%, 95\% CI -4\% to 0\%). Results were similar when trials were restricted to the four trials which permitted comparison of ART within two weeks to ART between two and eight weeks. Trials were conducted between 2004 and 2014, before recommendations to treat HIV at any CD4 count or to rapidly start ART in people without TB. No trials included children or pregnant women. No trials included integrase inhibitors in ART regimens.
DISCUSSION: Earlier ART did not alter risk of death overall among people living with HIV who had TB disease. For logistical and patient preference reasons, earlier ART initiation for everyone with TB and HIV may be preferred to later ART.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Outbreaks linked to cosmetic piercing are rare, but can cause significant illness. We report the investigation and management of a point-source outbreak that occurred during a Black Friday promotional event in North West England.
Methods: Outbreak investigation was led by Public Health England, and included active case finding among individuals pierced at a piercing premises between 25/11/2016 (Black Friday) and 7/12/2016. Detailed epidemiological, environmental (including inspection and sampling), and microbiological investigation was undertaken.
Results: During the Black Friday event (25/11/2016), 45 people were pierced (13 by a newly-appointed practitioner). Eleven cases were identified (7 microbiologically-confirmed, 2 probable, and 2 possible). All cases had clinical signs of infection around piercing sites, and five required surgical intervention, with varying degrees of post-operative disfigurement. All confirmed and probable cases had a scaffold piercing placed with a guide bar by the newly-appointed practitioner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indistinguishable at nine-locus variable-number tandem repeat loci, was isolated from four of the confirmed cases, and from pre- and post-flush samples from five separate water taps (three sinks) in the premises. Water samples taken after remedial plumbing work confirmed elimination of Pseudomonas contamination.
Discussion: Although high levels of Pseudomonas water contamination and some poor infection control procedures were identified, infection appeared to require additional exposure to an inexperienced practitioner, and the more invasive scaffold piercing. A proactive collaborative approach between piercers and health and environmental officials is required to reduce outbreak risk, particularly when unusually large events are planned.},

              Patients with tuberculosis (TB) symptoms in low-resource settings face convoluted diagnostic and treatment linkage pathways, incurring substantial health-seeking costs. In the context of a randomised trial looking at the impact of novel diagnostics such as computer-aided chest x-ray diagnosis (CAD4TB), we aimed to investigate the costs incurred by patients seeking TB diagnosis and whether optimised diagnostic interventions could result in a reduction in the cost faced by households.
            
            
              
                Methods:
              
              PROSPECT was a three-arm randomised trial conducted in a public primary health clinic in Blantyre, Malawi during 2018-2019 (trial arms: standard of care [SOC]; HIV testing [HIV]; HIV testing and CAD4TB [HIV/TB]). The direct and indirect costs incurred by 219 PROSPECT participants over the 56-day follow-up period were collected. Costs were deemed catastrophic if they exceeded 20\% of annual household income. We compared mean costs and used generalised linear regression models to examine whether the interventions could result in a reduction in total costs.
            
            
              
                Results:
              
              
              The mean total cost incurred by all 219 participants was US\$12.11 (standard error (SE): 1.86). The indirect and direct cost was US\$8.47 (SE: 1.66) and US\$3.64 (SE: 0.38), respectively. The mean total cost composed of 5.6\% of the average annual household income. In total, 5\% (9/180) of the participants with complete income data incurred catastrophic costs. Compared to SOC, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean total cost faced by those in the HIV (ratio: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.51, 1.19) and HIV/TB arms (ratio: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.53, 1.37).
            
            
              
                Conclusions:
              
              
              Despite the absence of user fees, patients seeking healthcare with TB symptoms incurred catastrophic costs. The optimised TB diagnostic interventions that were investigated in the PROSPECT study did not significantly reduce costs. TB diagnosis interventions should be implemented alongside social protection policies whilst ensuring healthcare facilities are accessible by the poor.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fishing exposes fishermen to schistosomiasis-infested fresh water and concurrently through precarious livelihoods to risky sexual behaviour, rendering these two infections occupational hazards for fishermen. This study aimed to characterize the knowledge of the two conditions to obtain necessary data for a subsequent cluster randomized trial designed to investigate demand creation strategies for joint HIV-schistosomiasis service provision in fishing villages on the shores of southern Lake Malawi.
METHODS: Enumeration of all resident fishermen in 45 clusters (fishing communities) was carried out between November 2019 and February 2020. In a baseline survey, fishermen reported their knowledge, attitudes and practices in the uptake of HIV and schistosomiasis services. Knowledge of HIV status and previous receipt of praziquantel were modelled using random effects binomial regression, accounting for clustering. Prevalence of willingness to attend a beach clinic was computed.
RESULTS: A total of 6,297 fishermen were surveyed from the 45 clusters with harmonic mean number of fishermen per cluster of 112 (95\% CI: 97; 134). The mean age was 31.7y (SD: 11.9) and nearly 40\% (2,474/6,297) could not read or write. Overall, 1,334/6,293 (21.2\%) had never tested for HIV, with 64.4\% (3,191/4,956) having tested in the last 12 months, and 5.9\% (373/6290) taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). In adjusted analyses, being able to read and write (adjusted risk ratio [aRR: 1.91, 95\% CI: 1.59-2.29, p{\textless}0.001); previous use of praziquantel (aRR: 2.00,95\% CI: 1.73-2.30, p{\textless}0.001); knowing a relative or friend who died of HIV (aRR: 1.54,95\% CI: 1.33-1.79, p{\textless}0.001); and being on ART (aRR: 12.93, 95\% CI: 6.25-32.93, p{\textless}0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of ever testing for HIV. Only 40\% (1,733/4,465) had received praziquantel in the last 12 months. Every additional year of age was associated with 1\% decreased likelihood of having taken praziquantel in the last 12 months (aRR: 0.99, 95\% CI: 0.98-0.99, p{\textless}0.001). However, recent HIV testing increased the likelihood of taking praziquantel by over 2-fold (aRR 2.24, 95\% CI: 1.93-2.62, p{\textless}0.001). Willingness to attend a mobile beach clinic offering integrated HIV and schistosomiasis services was extremely high at 99.0\% (6,224/6,284).
CONCLUSION: In a setting with an underlying high prevalence of both HIV and schistosomiasis, we found low knowledge of HIV status and low utilization of free schistosomiasis treatment. Among fishermen who accessed HIV services, there was a very high likelihood of taking praziquantel suggesting that integrated service delivery may lead to good coverage.

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) still causes 1.5 million deaths globally each year. Over recent decades, slow and uneven declines in TB incidence have resulted in a falling prevalence of TB disease, which increasingly concentrates in vulnerable populations. Falling prevalence, while welcome, poses new challenges for TB surveillance. Cross-sectional disease surveys require very large sample sizes to accurately estimate disease burden, and even more participants to detect trends over time or identify high-risk areas or populations, making them prohibitively resource-intensive. In the past, tuberculin skin surveys measuring Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) immunoreactivity were widely used to monitor TB epidemiology in high-incidence settings, but were limited by challenges with both delivering and interpreting the test. Here we argue that the shifting epidemiology of tuberculosis, and the development of new tests for Mtb infection, make it timely and important to revisit the strategy of TB surveillance based on infection or immunoreactivity. Mtb infection surveys carry their own operational challenges and fundamental questions, for example: around survey design and frequency; which groups should be included; how the prevalence of immunoreactivity in a population should be used to estimate force of infection; how individual results should be interpreted and managed; and how surveillance can be delivered efficiently and ethically. However, if these knowledge gaps are addressed, the relative feasibility and lower costs of Mtb infection surveillance offer a powerful and affordable opportunity to better “know your TB epidemic”, understand trends, identify high-risk and underserved communities, and tailor public health responses to dynamic epidemiology.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence shows rapidly changing tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology in Southern and Eastern Africa, with need for subdistrict prevalence estimates to guide targeted interventions. We conducted a pulmonary TB prevalence survey to estimate current TB burden in Blantyre city, Malawi. From May 2019 to March 2020, 115 households in middle/high-density residential Blantyre, were randomly-selected from each of 72 clusters. Consenting eligible participants (household residents ≥ 18 years) were interviewed, including for cough (any duration), and offered HIV testing and chest X-ray; participants with cough and/or abnormal X-ray provided two sputum samples for microscopy, Xpert MTB/Rif and mycobacterial culture. TB disease prevalence and risk factors for prevalent TB were calculated using complete-case analysis, multiple imputation, and inverse probability weighting. Of 20,899 eligible adults, 15,897 (76\%) were interviewed, 13,490/15,897 (85\%) had X-ray, and 1,120/1,394 (80\%) sputum-eligible participants produced at least one specimen, giving 15,318 complete cases (5,895, 38\% men). 29/15,318 had bacteriologically-confirmed TB (189 per 100,000 complete-case (cc) / 150 per 100,000 with inverse weighting (iw)). Men had higher burden (cc: 305 [95\% CI:144-645] per 100,000) than women (cc: 117 [95\% CI:65-211] per 100,000): cc adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.70 (1.26-5.78). Other significant risk factors for prevalent TB on complete-case analysis were working age (25-49 years) and previous TB treatment, but not HIV status. Multivariable analysis of imputed data was limited by small numbers, but previous TB and age group 25-49 years remained significantly associated with higher TB prevalence. Pulmonary TB prevalence for Blantyre was considerably lower than the 1,014 per 100,000 for urban Malawi in the 2013-14 national survey, at 150-189 per 100,000 adults, but some groups, notably men, remain disproportionately affected. TB case-finding is still needed for TB elimination in Blantyre, and similar urban centres, but should focus on reaching the highest risk groups, such as older men.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: People with radiographic evidence for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), but negative sputum cultures, have increased risk of developing culture-positive TB. Recent expansion of X-ray screening is leading to increased identification of this group. We set out to synthesise the evidence for treatment to prevent progression to culture-positive disease.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched for prospective trials evaluating the efficacy of TB regimens against placebo, observation, or alternative regimens, for the treatment of adults and children with radiographic evidence of TB but culture-negative respiratory samples. Databases were searched up to 18 Oct 2022. Study quality was assessed using ROB 2·0 and ROBINS-I. The primary outcome was progression to culture-positive TB. Meta-analysis with a random effects model was conducted to estimate pooled efficacy. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021248486).
FINDINGS: We included 13 trials (32,568 individuals) conducted between 1955 and 2018. Radiographic and bacteriological criteria for inclusion varied. 19·1\% to 57·9\% of participants with active x-ray changes and no treatment progressed to culture-positive disease. Progression was reduced with any treatment (6 studies, risk ratio [RR] 0·27, 95\%CI 0·13-0·56), although multi-drug TB treatment (RR 0·11, 95\%CI 0·05-0·23) was significantly more effective than isoniazid treatment (RR 0·63, 95\%CI 0·35-1·13) (p = 0·0002).
INTERPRETATION: Multi-drug regimens were associated with significantly reduced risk of progression to TB disease for individuals with radiographically apparent, but culture-negative TB. However, most studies were old, conducted prior to the HIV epidemic and with outdated regimens. New clinical trials are required to identify the optimal treatment approach.},

Following a pre-intervention prevalence survey (May 2019 to March 2020), constrained randomisation allocated neighbourhoods to either door-to-door ACF (sputum microscopy for reported cough {\textgreater}2 weeks) or standard-of-care (SOC). Implementation was interrupted by COVID-19. Cluster-level bacteriologically-confirmed case-notification rate (CNR) ratio within 91 days of ACF was our redefined primary outcome; comparison between arms used Poisson regression with random effects. Secondary outcomes were 91-day CNR ratios comparing all tuberculosis registrations and all non-ACF registrations. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis of CNRs in the SOC arm examined prevalence survey impact. (ISRCTN11400592). 72 clusters served by 10 study-supported tuberculosis registration centres were randomised to ACF (261,244 adults, 58,944 person-years follow-up) or SOC (256,713 adults, 52,805 person-years). Of 1,192 ACF participants, 13 (1.09\%) were smear-positive. Within 91 days, 113 (42 bacteriologically-confirmed) and 108 (33 bacteriologically-confirmed) tuberculosis patients were identified as ACF or SOC cluster residents, respectively. There was no difference by arm, with adjusted 91-day CNR ratios 1.12 (95\% CI: 0.61-2.07) for bacteriologically-confirmed tuberculosis; 0.93 (95\% CI: 0.68-1.28) for all tuberculosis registrations; and 0.86 (95\%CI: 0.63-1.16) for non-ACF (routinely) diagnosed. Of 7,905 ACF and 7,992 SOC pre-intervention survey participants, 12 (0.15\%) and 17 (0.21\%), respectively, had culture/Xpert-confirmed tuberculosis. ITS analysis showed no survey impact on SOC CNRs. Despite residual undiagnosed tuberculosis of 150 per 100,000 population, there was no increase in tuberculosis notifications from this previously successful approach targeting symptomatic disease, likely due to previous TB ACF and rapid declines in TB burden. In such settings, future ACF should focus on targeted outreach and demand creation, alongside optimised facility-based screening. Trial Registration: ISRCTN11400592.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission of syphilis remains high especially in the WHO AFRO region with a prevalence of 1.62\%, resulting in a congenital syphilis rate of 1,119 per 100,000 live births. Elimination efforts can be supported by an understanding of the spatial and temporal changes in disease over time, which can identify priority areas for targeted interventions aimed at reducing transmission.
METHODS: We collated routine surveillance data from health facilities and covariate data from demographic and health surveys conducted in Malawi between 2014 and 2022. We fitted a Bayesian hierarchical mixed model with spatial and temporally structured random effects to model the district-level monthly counts of maternal syphilis notifications as a function of individual- and district-level predictors. We then generated district-level spatiotemporally explicit risk profiles to estimate the effect of individual- and district-level covariates on maternal syphilis notifications and to identify hotspot areas.
RESULTS: Overall, the national prevalence of maternal syphilis increased from 0.28\% (95\% CI: 0.27-0.29\%) in 2014 to peaking in 2021 at 1.92\% (95\% CI: 1.89-1.96\%). Between 2020 and 2022, there was a decline in prevalence, with the most significant decline seen in Zomba District (1.40, 95\% CI: 1.12-1.66\%). In regression models, a one percentage point increase in district-level antenatal HIV prevalence was associated with increased maternal syphilis (prevalence ratio [PR]: 1.15, 95\% credible interval [CrI]: 1.10-1.21). There was also an increased prevalence of maternal syphilis associated with an increased district-level mean number of sex partners (PR: 1.05, 95\% CrI: 0.80-1.37). The number of districts with a high prevalence of maternal syphilis also increased between 2014 and 2022, especially in the southern region, where most had a high probability (approaching 100\%) of having high maternal syphilis (defined as relative risk {\textgreater}1 compared to the standard population of women aged 15-49 years) in 2022.
CONCLUSION: Maternal syphilis prevalence in Malawi shows an increasing upward trend, with an estimated six times relative increase between 2014 and 2022 (0.28\% to 1.73\%) and strong associations with higher district-level HIV prevalence. Controlling syphilis depends on reaching vulnerable populations at the sub-national level, which may be disproportionately affected. Our findings support the move to integrate the elimination of mother-to-child transmission (EMTCT) of syphilis programs with existing prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV programs.},

We conducted a mixed methods evaluation of the implementation of services for early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV against national guidelines in Blantyre, Malawi, to inform the development of strategies to improve EID services uptake. We estimated coverage of HEI enrolment in HIV care and HIV testing at 6 weeks through a retrospective data review. We qualitatively explored implementation gaps in EID services through process mapping of 8 mother-infant pairs (MIP); and investigated healthcare workers' (HCW) perspectives on the implementation gaps through group interviews with 16 HCWs. We analysed the quantitative data descriptively and conducted a thematic content analysis of qualitative data. Of 163 HEIs born at the study sites, 39 (24\%) were enrolled in an HIV care clinic before post-natal discharge, and 85 (52\%) received HIV testing by 6 weeks. The median time for MIP to receive EID services was 4 (1-8) hours. The implementation gaps observed during process mapping included: failure to identify and enrol HEI in HIV care clinic; lack of immunisation, counselling for HEI testing, HIV testing, drug refilling, and family planning; and different appointment dates for mother and infant. HCWs reported delays and gaps influencing optimal service provision including: lack of screening to identify MIP, limited supervision for student HCWs when providing services, inadequate capacity of point of care machines, challenges with integrating services, and role confusion. Use of unique identifiers for MIP and establishing a booking system to schedule appointments to suit point of care machine capacity were primary service improvement recommendations. This study identified suboptimal EID services in Malawi due to process, capacity, and system factors. Context-appropriate interventions accommodating systems thinking are needed to enhance service provision.},

	abstract = {Community-based active case finding (ACF) for tuberculosis (TB) involves an offer of screening to populations at risk of TB, oftentimes with additional health promotion, community engagement and health service strengthening. Recently updated World Health Organization TB screening guidelines conditionally recommend expanded offer of ACF for communities where the prevalence of undiagnosed pulmonary TB is greater than 0.5\% among adults, or with other structural risk factors for TB. Subclinical TB is thought to be a major contributor to TB transmission, and ACF, particularly with chest X-ray screening, could lead to earlier diagnosis. However, the evidence base for the population-level impact of ACF is mixed, with effectiveness likely highly dependent on the screening approach used, the intensity with which ACF is delivered, and the success of community- and health-system participation. With recent changes in TB epidemiology due to the effective scale-up of treatment for HIV in Africa, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the importance of subclinical TB, researchers and public health practitioners planning to implement ACF programmes must carefully and repeatedly consider the potential population and individual benefits and harms from these programmes. Here we synthesise evidence and experience from implementing ACF programmes to provide practical guidance, focusing on the selection of populations, screening algorithms, selecting outcomes, and monitoring and evaluation. With careful planning and substantial investment, community-based ACF for TB can be an impactful approach to accelerating progress towards elimination of TB in high-burden countries. However, ACF cannot and should not be a substitute for equitable access to responsive, affordable, accessible primary care services for all.},

	abstract = {Background In absence of contraindications, same-day initiation (SDI) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended for people testing HIV-positive who are ready to start treatment. Until 2021, World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines considered the presence of TB symptoms (presumptive TB) a contraindication to SDI due to the risk of TB-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS). To reduce TB-IRIS risk, ART initiation was recommended to be postponed until results of TB investigations were available, and TB treatment initiated if active TB was confirmed. In 2021, the WHO guidelines changed to recommending SDI even in the presence of TB symptoms without awaiting results of TB investigations based on the assumption that TB investigations often unnecessarily delay ART initiation, increasing the risk for pre-ART attrition from care, and noting that the clinical relevance of TB-IRIS outside the central nervous system remains unclear. However, this guideline change was not based on conclusive evidence, and it remains unclear whether SDI of ART or TB test results should be prioritized in people with HIV (PWH) and presumptive TB. Design and methods SaDAPT is an open-label, pragmatic, parallel, 1:1 individually randomized, non-inferiority trial comparing two strategies for the timing of ART initiation in PWH with presumptive TB (“ART first” versus “TB results first”). PWH in Lesotho and Malawi, aged 12 years and older (re)initiating ART who have at least one TB symptom (cough, fever, night sweats or weight loss) and no signs of intracranial infection are eligible. After a baseline assessment, participants in the “ART first” arm will be offered SDI of ART, while those in the “TB results first” arm will be offered ART only after active TB has been confirmed or refuted. We hypothesize that the “ART first” approach is safe and non-inferior to the “TB results first” approach with regard to HIV viral suppression ({\textless}400 copies/ml) six months after enrolment. Secondary outcomes include retention in care and adverse events consistent with TB-IRIS. Expected outcomes SaDAPT will provide evidence on the safety and effects of SDI of ART in PWH with presumptive TB in a pragmatic clinical trial setting.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an open fracture intervention bundle on clinical management and patient outcomes of adults in Malawi with open tibia fractures.
METHODS: We conducted a before-and-after implementation study in Malawi in 2021 and 2022 to assess the impact of an open fracture intervention bundle, including a national education course for clinical officers and management guidelines for open fractures. We recruited 287 patients with open tibia fractures. The primary outcome was a before-and-after comparison of the self-reported short musculoskeletal function assessment score, a measure of patient function. Secondary outcomes included clinical management; and clinician knowledge and implementation evaluation outcomes of 57 health-care providers attending the course. We also constructed multilevel regression models to investigate associations between clinical knowledge, patient function, and implementation evaluation before and after the intervention.
FINDINGS: The median patient function score at 1 year was 6.8 (interquartile range, IQR: 1.5 to 14.5) before intervention and 8.4 (IQR: 3.8 to 23.2) after intervention. Compared with baseline scores, we found clinicians' open fracture knowledge scores improved 1 year after the intervention was implemented (mean posterior difference: 1.6, 95\% highest density interval: 0.9 to 2.4). However, we found no difference in most aspects of clinicians' open fracture management practice.
CONCLUSION: Despite possible improvement in clinician knowledge and positive evaluation of the intervention implementation, our study showed that there was no overall improvement in clinical management, and weak evidence of worsening patient function 1 year after injury, after implementation of the open fracture intervention bundle.},

Through an international Delphi exercise that involved 71 participants representing a wide range of disciplines, sectors, income settings, and geographies, consensus was reached on a set of conceptual states, related terminology, and research gaps. The International Consensus for Early TB (ICE-TB) framework distinguishes disease from infection by the presence of macroscopic pathology and defines two subclinical and two clinical tuberculosis states on the basis of reported symptoms or signs of tuberculosis, further differentiated by likely infectiousness. The presence of viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis and an associated host response are prerequisites for all states of infection and disease.

	abstract = {Despite 30 years as a public health emergency, tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the world’s deadliest diseases. Most deaths are among persons with TB who are not reached with diagnosis and treatment. Thus, timely screening and accurate detection of TB, particularly using sensitive tools such as chest radiography, is crucial for reducing the global burden of this disease. However, lack of qualified human resources represents a common limiting factor in many high TB-burden countries. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful complement in many facets of life, including for the interpretation of chest X-ray images. However, while AI may serve as a viable alternative to human radiographers and radiologists, there is a high likelihood that those suffering from TB will not reap the benefits of this technological advance without appropriate, clinically effective use and cost-conscious deployment. The World Health Organization recommended the use of AI for TB screening in 2021, and early adopters of the technology have been using the technology in many ways. In this manuscript, we present a compilation of early user experiences from nine high TB-burden countries focused on practical considerations and best practices related to deployment, threshold and use case selection, and scale-up. While we offer technical and operational guidance on the use of AI for interpreting chest X-ray images for TB detection, our aim remains to maximize the benefit that programs, implementers, and ultimately TB-affected individuals can derive from this innovative technology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: People with HIV (PHIV) admitted to hospital have high mortality, with tuberculosis (TB) being the major cause of death. Systematic use of new TB diagnostics could improve TB diagnosis and might improve outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomised trial among adult PHIV admitted to Zomba Central Hospital, Malawi. Admission-days were randomly assigned to: enhanced TB diagnostics using urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen tests (SILVAMP-LAM, Fujifilm, Japan and Determine-LAM, Alere/Abbot, USA), digital chest X-ray with computer aided diagnosis (dCXR-CAD, CAD4TBv6, Delft, Netherlands), plus usual care ("enhanced TB diagnostics"); or usual care alone ("usual care"). The primary outcome was TB treatment initiation during admission. Secondary outcomes were 56-day mortality, TB diagnosis within 24-hours, and undiagnosed TB at discharge, ascertained by culture of one admission sputum sample.
FINDINGS: Between 2 September 2020 and 15 February 2022, we recruited 419 people. Four people were excluded post-recruitment, leaving 415 adults recruited during 207 randomly assigned admission-days in modified intention-to-treat analysis. At admission, 90.8\% (377/415) were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) with median (IQR) CD4 cell count 240 cells/mm3. In the enhanced diagnostic arm, median CAD4TBv6 score was 60 (IQR: 51-71), 4.4\% (9/207) had SILVAMP-LAM-positive and 14.4\% (29/201) had Determine-LAM positive urine with three samples positive by both urine tests. TB treatment was initiated in 46/208 (22\%) in enhanced TB diagnostics arm and 24/207 (12\%) in usual care arm (risk ratio [RR] 1.92, 95\% CI 1.20-3.08). There was no difference in mortality by 56 days (enhanced TB diagnosis: 54/208, 26\%; usual care: 52/207, 25\%; hazard ratio 1.05, 95\% CI 0.72-1.53); TB treatment initiation within 24 hours (enhanced TB diagnosis: 8/207, 3.9\%; usual care: 5/208, 2.4\%; RR 1.61, 95\% CI 0.53-4.71); or undiagnosed microbiological-confirmed TB at discharge (enhanced TB diagnosis, 0/207 (0.0\%), usual care arm 2/208 (1.0\%) (p = 0.50).
INTERPRETATION: Urine SILVAMP-LAM/Determine-LAM plus dCXR-CAD diagnostics identified more hospitalised PHIV with TB than usual care. The increase in TB treatment appeared mainly due to greater use of Determine-LAM, rather than SILVAMP-LAM or dCXR-CAD. Poor concordance between Determine-LAM and SILVAMP-LAM urine tests requires further investigation. Inpatient mortality for adults with HIV remains unacceptability high.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) transmission and prevalence are dynamic over time, and heterogeneous within populations. Public health programmes therefore require up-to-date, accurate epidemiological data to appropriately allocate resources, target interventions, and track progress towards End TB goals. Current methods of TB surveillance often rely on case notifications, which are biased by access to healthcare, and TB disease prevalence surveys, which are highly resource-intensive, requiring many tens of thousands of people to be tested to identify high-risk groups or capture trends. Surveys of "latent TB infection", or immunoreactivity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), using tests such as interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) could provide a way to identify TB transmission hotspots, supplementing information from disease notifications, and with greater spatial and temporal resolution than is possible to achieve in disease prevalence surveys. This cross-sectional survey will investigate the prevalence of Mtb immunoreactivity amongst young children, adolescents and adults in Blantyre, Malawi, a high HIV-prevalence city in southern Africa. Through this study we will estimate the annual risk of TB infection (ARTI) in Blantyre and explore individual- and area-level risk factors for infection, as well as investigating geospatial heterogeneity of Mtb infection (and its determinants), and comparing these to the distribution of TB disease case-notifications. We will also evaluate novel diagnostics for Mtb infection (QIAreach QFT) and sampling methodologies (convenience sampling in healthcare settings and community sampling based on satellite imagery), which may increase the feasibility of measuring Mtb infection at large scale. The overall aim is to provide high-resolution epidemiological data and provide new insights into methodologies which may be used by TB programmes globally.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be challenging to diagnose when sputum samples cannot be obtained, which is especially problematic in children and older people. We systematically appraised the performance characteristics and diagnostic accuracy of upper respiratory tract sampling for diagnosing active pulmonary tuberculosis.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Cinahl, Web of Science, Global Health, and Global Health Archive databases for studies published between database inception and Dec 6, 2022 that reported on the accuracy of upper respiratory tract sampling for tuberculosis diagnosis compared with microbiological testing of sputum or gastric aspirate reference standard. We included studies that evaluated the accuracy of upper respiratory tract sampling (laryngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirate, oral swabs, saliva, mouth wash, nasal swabs, plaque samples, and nasopharyngeal swabs) to be tested for microbiological diagnosis of tuberculous (by culture and nucleic acid amplification tests) compared with a reference standard using either sputum or gastric lavage for a microbiological test. We included cohort, case-control, cross-sectional, and randomised controlled studies that recruited participants from any community or clinical setting. We excluded post-mortem studies. We used a random-effects meta-analysis with a bivariate hierarchical model to estimate pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostics odds ratio (DOR; odds of a positive test with disease relative to without), stratified by sampling method. We assessed bias using QUADAS-2 criteria. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021262392).
FINDINGS: We screened 10 159 titles for inclusion, reviewed 274 full texts, and included 71, comprising 119 test comparisons published between May 13, 1933, and Dec 19, 2022, in the systematic review (53 in the meta-analysis). For laryngeal swabs, pooled sensitivity was 57·8\% (95\% CI 50·5-65·0), specificity was 93·8\% (88·4-96·8), and DOR was 20·7 (11·1-38·8). Nasopharyngeal aspirate sensitivity was 65·2\% (52·0-76·4), specificity was 97·9\% (96·0-99·0), and DOR was 91·0 (37·8-218·8). Oral swabs sensitivity was 56·7\% (44·3-68·2), specificity was 91·3\% (CI 81·0-96·3), and DOR was 13·8 (5·6-34·0). Substantial heterogeneity in diagnostic accuracy was found, probably due to differences in reference and index standards.
INTERPRETATION: Upper respiratory tract sampling holds promise to expand access to tuberculosis diagnosis. Exploring historical methods using modern microbiological techniques might further increase options for alternative sample types. Prospective studies are needed to optimise accuracy and utility of sampling methods in clinical practice.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injuries are a major cause of disability globally and injury incidence is rapidly increasing, largely due to road traffic injuries in low-income and middle-income countries. Current estimates of the scale and consequences of disability from injury are largely based on modelling studies, with a scarcity of empirical evidence from severe injuries in low-income countries. We aimed to better understand the outcomes for individuals with open tibia fractures in Malawi.
METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective cohort study, adults (aged ≥18 years) with open tibia fractures were systematically recruited at six hospitals in Malawi (two tertiary hospitals and four district hospitals). Follow-up lasted at least 1 year, during which in-person follow-up reviews were done at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-injury. The primary outcome was function at 1 year post-injury, measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA) score. Secondary outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; as determined via the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 3-Levels [EQ-5D-3L] survey) and fracture-related infection at 1 year post-injury. Multilevel regression models investigated associations between SMFA score, EQ-5D-3L, baseline factors, and orthopaedic management.
FINDINGS: Between Feb 12, 2021, and March 14, 2022, 287 participants were enrolled (median age 34 years [IQR 25-44]; 84\% male). The most common mode of injury was road traffic injuries (194 [68\%] of 287). Overall, 268 (93\%) participants had debridement; of the 63 participants who were debrided in district hospitals, 47 (75\%) had the procedure under local or no anaesthesia. Following substantial declines by 6 weeks after injury, function and quality of life had not recovered by 1 year post-injury for participants with Gustilo grade I-II fractures (posterior mean SMFA at 1 year: 10·5, 95\% highest density interval [HDI]: 9·5-11·6; QALYs: 0·73, 95\% HDI: 0·66-0·80) nor Gustilo grade III fractures (posterior mean SMFA at 1 year: 14·9, 95\% HDI: 13·4-16·6; QALYs: 0·67, 95\% HDI: 0·59-0·75). For all fracture grades, intramedullary nailing substantially improved function and quality of life at 1 year post-injury. Delayed definitive fixation after 5 days had 5-times greater odds of infection compared with early management within 2 days (adjusted odds ratio: 5·1, 95\% CI 1·8-16·1; p=0·02).
INTERPRETATION: Adults with open tibia fractures in Malawi have poor function and quality of life in the 1 year following injury. Centralised orthopaedic surgical management, including early definitive fixation and intramedullary nailing for more severe injuries, might improve outcomes.

	abstract = {SETTING: Equitable access to TB testing is vital for achieving global diagnosis and treatment targets, but access to diagnostic services is often worse in poorer communities. The SCALE (Sustainable Community-wide Active case-finding for Lung hEalth) survey estimated TB prevalence in Blantyre City, Malawi, and recorded previous engagement with TB services.OBJECTIVE: To explore local variation in the prevalence of ever-testing for TB in Blantyre and investigate potential socio-economic drivers.DESIGN: We fit a mixed-effects model to self-reported prior TB testing from survey participants across 72 neighbourhood clusters, adjusted for sex, age and HIV status and with cluster-level random intercepts. We then evaluated to what extent cluster-level variation was explained by two alternate poverty indicators.RESULTS: We observed substantial variation between clusters in previous TB testing, with little correlation between neighbouring clusters. Individuals residing in less affluent households, on average, had lower odds of having undergone prior testing. However, adjusting for poverty did not explain the cluster-level variations observed.CONCLUSION: Despite a decade of increased active case-finding efforts, access to TB testing is inconsistent across the population of Blantyre. This likely reflects health inequities that also apply to TB testing in many other settings, and motivates collection and analysis of TB testing data to identify the drivers behind these inequities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis case-finding interventions are critical to meeting World Health Organization End TB strategy goals. We investigated the impact of community-wide tuberculosis active case finding (ACF) alongside scale-up of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and care on trends in adult tuberculosis case notification rates (CNRs) in Blantyre, Malawi.
METHODS: Five rounds of ACF for tuberculosis (1-2 weeks of leafleting, door-to-door enquiry for cough and sputum microscopy) were delivered to neighborhoods ("ACF areas") in North-West Blantyre between April 2011 and August 2014. Many of these neighborhoods also had concurrent HIV testing interventions. The remaining neighborhoods in Blantyre City ("non-ACF areas") provided a non-randomized comparator. We analyzed TB CNRs from January 2009 until December 2018. We used interrupted time series analysis to compare tuberculosis CNRs before ACF and after ACF, and between ACF and non-ACF areas.
RESULTS: Tuberculosis CNRs increased in Blantyre concurrently with start of ACF for tuberculosis in both ACF and non-ACF areas, with a larger magnitude in ACF areas. Compared to a counterfactual where pre-ACF CNR trends continued during ACF period, we estimated there were an additional 101 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 42 to 160) microbiologically confirmed (Bac+) tuberculosis diagnoses per 100 000 person-years in the ACF areas in 3 and a half years of ACF. Compared to a counterfactual where trends in ACF area were the same as trends in non-ACF areas, we estimated an additional 63 (95\% CI 38 to 90) Bac + diagnoses per 100 000 person-years in the same period.
CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis ACF was associated with a rapid increase in people diagnosed with tuberculosis in Blantyre.},

Use of antibiotics, particularly in contexts where weaker regulatory frameworks make informal access easier, has been identified as an important driver of AMR. However, knowledge is limited about the ways antibiotics are used in communities in Malawi and sub-Saharan Africa. Between April and July 2021, we undertook a cross-sectional survey of community antibiotic use practices in Blantyre, Malawi. We selected two densely-populated neighbourhoods (Chilomoni and Ndirande) and one peri-urban neighbourhood (Chileka) and undertook detailed interviews to assess current and recent antibiotic use, supported by the innovative "drug bag" methodology. Regression modelling investigated associations with patterns of antibiotic recognition. We interviewed 217 households with a total of 1051 household members. The number of antibiotics recognised was significantly lower among people with poorer formal health care access (people with unknown HIV status vs. HIV-negative, adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.76, 95\% CI: 0.77-.099) and amongst men (aOR: 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.69-0.99), who are less likely to support healthcare-seeking for family members. Reported antibiotic use was mostly limited to a small number of antibiotics (amoxicillin, erythromycin and cotrimoxazole), with current antibiotic use reported by 67/1051 (6.4\%) and recent use (last 6 months) by 440/1051 (41.9\%). Our findings support the need for improved access to quality healthcare in urban and peri-urban African settings to promote appropriate antibiotic use and limit the development and spread of AMR.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: TB is a leading cause of morbidity among HIV positive individuals. Accurate algorithms are needed to achieve early TB diagnosis and treatment. We investigated the use of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra in combination with chest radiography for TB diagnosis in ambulatory HIV positive individuals.
METHODS: This was a randomised controlled trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design. Outpatient HIV clinic attendees with cough were randomised to four arms: Arm 1-Standard Xpert/no chest radiography (CXR); Arm 2-Standard Xpert/CXR; Arm 3-Xpert Ultra/no CXR; and Arm 4-Xpert Ultra/CXR. Participants were followed up at days 28 and 56 to assess for TB treatment initiation.
RESULTS: We randomised 640 participants. Bacteriologically confirmed TB treatment initiation at day 28 were: Arm 1 (8.4\% [14/162]), Arm 2 (6.9\% [11/159]), Arm 3 (8.2\% [13/159]) and Arm 4 (5.6\% [9/160]) and between Xpert Ultra group (Arms 3 and 4) (6.9\% [22/319]) vs Standard Xpert group (Arms 1 and 2) (7.8\% [25/321]), risk ratio 0.89 (95\% CI 0.51 to 1.54). By day 56, there were also similar all-TB treatment initiations in the x-ray group (Arms 2 and 4) (16.0\% [51/319]) compared with the no x-ray group (Arms 1 and 3) (13.1\% [42/321]), risk ratio 1.22 (95\% CI 0.84 to 1.78); however, the contribution of clinically diagnosed treatment initiations were higher in x-ray groups (50.9\% vs 19.0\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Xpert Ultra performed similarly to Xpert MTB/RIF. X-rays are useful for TB screening but further research should investigate how to mitigate false-positive treatment initiations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Household contact tracing for tuberculosis (TB) may facilitate diagnosis and access to TB preventive treatment (TPT). We investigated whether household contact tracing and intensive TB/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening would improve TB-free survival.
METHODS: Household contacts of index TB patients in 2 South African provinces were randomized to home tracing and intensive HIV/TB screening or standard of care (SOC; clinic referral letters). The primary outcome was incident TB or death at 15 months. Secondary outcomes included tuberculin skin test (TST) positivity in children ≤14 years and undiagnosed HIV.
RESULTS: From December 2016 through March 2019, 1032 index patients (4459 contacts) and 1030 (4129 contacts) were randomized to the intervention and SOC arms. Of intervention arm contacts, 3.2\% (69 of 2166) had prevalent microbiologically confirmed TB. At 15 months, the cumulative incidence of TB or death did not differ between the intensive screening (93 of 3230, 2.9\%) and SOC (80 of 2600, 3.1\%) arms (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval [CI], .66-1.24). TST positivity was higher in the intensive screening arm (38 of 845, 4.5\%) compared with the SOC arm (15 of 800, 1.9\%; odds ratio, 2.25; 95\% CI, 1.07-4.72).

CONCLUSIONS: Household contact tracing with intensive screening and referral did not reduce incident TB or death. Providing referral letters to household contacts of index patients is an alternative strategy to home visits.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of diseases other than tuberculosis (TB) detected during chest X-ray screening is poorly described in sub-Saharan Africa. Computer-assisted digital chest X-ray technology is available for TB screening and has the potential to be a screening tool for non-communicable diseases as well. Low- and middle-income countries are in a transition period where the burden of non-communicable diseases is increasing, but health systems are mainly focused on addressing infectious diseases.
METHODS: Participants were adults undergoing computer-assisted chest X-ray screening for tuberculosis in a community-wide tuberculosis prevalence survey in Blantyre, Malawi. Adults with abnormal radiographs by field radiographer interpretation were evaluated by a physician in a community-based clinic. X-ray classifications were compared to classifications of a random sample of normal chest X-rays by radiographer interpretation. Radiographic features were classified using WHO Integrated Management for Adult Illnesses (IMAI) guidelines. All radiographs taken at the screening tent were analysed by the Qure.ai qXR v2.0 software.
RESULTS: 5\% (648/13,490) of adults who underwent chest radiography were identified to have an abnormal chest X-ray by the radiographer. 387 (59.7\%) of the participants attended the X-ray clinic, and another 387 randomly sampled normal X-rays were available for comparison. Participants who were referred to the community clinic had a significantly higher HIV prevalence than those who had been identified to have a normal CXR by the field radiographer (90 [23.3\%] vs. 43 [11.1\%] p-value {\textless} 0.001). The commonest radiographic finding was cardiomegaly (20.7\%, 95\% CI 18.0-23.7). One in five (81/387) chest X-rays were misclassified by the radiographer. The overall mean Qure.ai qXR v2.0 score for all reviewed X-rays was 0.23 (SD 0.20). There was a high concordance of cardiomegaly classification between the physician and the computer-assisted software (109/118, 92.4\%).
CONCLUSION: There is a high burden of cardiomegaly on a chest X-ray at a community level, much of which is in patients with diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure. Cardiomegaly on chest X-ray may be a potential tool for screening for cardiovascular NCDs at the primary care level as well as in the community.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate trends in population incidence of HIV-positive hospital admission and risk of in-hospital death among adults living with HIV between 2012 and 2019 in Blantyre, Malawi.
DESIGN: Population cohort study using an existing electronic health information system ('SPINE') at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital and Blantyre census data.
METHODS: We used multiple imputation and negative binomial regression to estimate population age-specific and sex-specific admission rates over time. We used a log-binomial model to investigate trends in risk of in-hospital death.
RESULTS: Of 32 814 adult medical admissions during Q4 2012--Q3 2019, HIV status was recorded for 75.6\%. HIV-positive admissions decreased substantially between 2012 and 2019. After imputation for missing data, HIV-positive admissions were highest in Q3 2013 (173 per 100 000 adult Blantyre residents) and lowest in Q3 2019 (53 per 100 000 residents). An estimated 10 818 fewer than expected people with HIV (PWH) [95\% confidence interval (CI) 10 068-11 568] were admitted during 2012-2019 compared with the counterfactual situation where admission rates stayed the same throughout this period. Absolute reductions were greatest for women aged 25-34 years (2264 fewer HIV-positive admissions, 95\% CI 2002-2526). In-hospital mortality for PWH was 23.5\%, with no significant change over time in any age-sex group, and no association with antiretroviral therapy (ART) use at admission.
CONCLUSION: Rates of admission for adult PWH decreased substantially, likely because of large increases in community provision of HIV diagnosis, treatment and care. However, HIV-positive in-hospital deaths remain unacceptably high, despite improvements in ART coverage. A concerted research and implementation agenda is urgently needed to reduce inpatient deaths among PWH.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) control relies on early diagnosis and treatment. International guidelines recommend systematic TB screening at health facilities, but implementation is challenging. We investigated completion of recommended TB screening steps in Blantyre, Malawi.
METHODS: A prospective cohort recruited adult outpatients attending Bangwe primary clinic. Entry interviews were linked to exit interviews. The proportion of participants progressing through each step of the diagnostic pathway were estimated. Factors associated with request for sputum were investigated using multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 5442 clinic attendances 2397 (44\%) had exit interviews. In clinically indicated participants (n = 445) 256 (57.5\%) were asked about cough, 36 (8.1\%) were asked for sputum, 21 (4.7\%) gave sputum and 1 (0.2\%) received same-day results. Significant associations with request for sputum were: any TB symptom (aOR:3.20, 95\%CI:2.02-5.06), increasing age (aOR:1.02, 95\%CI:1.01-1.04 per year) and for HIV-negative participants only, a history of previous TB (aOR:3.37, 95\%CI:1.45-7.81). Numbers requiring sputum tests (26/day) outnumbered diagnostic capacity (8-12/day).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients were lost at every stage of the TB care cascade, with same day sputum submission following all steps of the diagnosis cascade achieved in only 4.7\% if clinically indicated. Infection control strategies should be implemented, with reporting on early steps of the TB care cascade formalised. High-throughput screening interventions, such as digital CXR, that can achieve same-day TB diagnosis are urgently needed to meet WHO End TB goals.},

However, 333 fewer cumulative TB notifications were received than anticipated. Women and girls were affected more (30.7\% fewer cases) than men and boys (20.9\% fewer cases). Fear of COVID-19 infection, temporary facility closures, inadequate personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 stigma because of similar symptoms to TB were mentioned as reasons for fewer people being diagnosed with TB.

This study aims to investigate disability and economic outcomes of people with open tibia fractures in Malawi and improve these with locally delivered implementation of open fracture guidelines. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study describing function, quality of life and economic burden of open tibia fractures in Malawi. In total, 160 participants will be recruited across six centres and will be followed-up with face-to-face interviews at six weeks, three months, six months and one year following injury. The primary outcome will be function at one year measured by the short musculoskeletal functional assessment (SMFA) score. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life measured by EuroQol EQ-5D-3L, catastrophic loss of income and implementation outcomes (acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, costs, feasibility, fidelity, penetration, and sustainability) at one year. A nested pilot pre-post implementation study of an interventional bundle for all open fractures will be developed based on other implementation studies from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Regression analysis will be used to model and investigate associations between SMFA score and fracture severity, infection and the pre- and post-training course period. Outcome: This prospective cohort study will report patient reported outcomes from open tibia fractures in low-resource settings. Subsequent detailed evaluation of both the clinical and implementation components of the study will promote sustainability of improved open fractures management in the study sites and further scale-up of open fracture management guidelines. Ethics: Ethics approval has been obtained from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and College of Medicine Research and Ethics committee.},

The risks and benefits of same-day ART initiation in PLHIV with tuberculosis symptoms are unknown.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed nine databases on 12 March 2020 to identify studies that investigated same-day ART initiation among PLHIV with tuberculosis symptoms and reported both their approach to TB screening and clinical outcomes. We extracted and summarized data about TB screening, numbers of people starting same-day ART and outcomes.
RESULTS: We included four studies. Two studies deferred ART for everyone with any tuberculosis symptoms (one or more of cough, fever, night sweats or weight loss) and substantial numbers of people had deferred ART start (28\% and 39\% did not start same-day ART). Two studies permitted some people with tuberculosis symptoms to start same-day ART, and fewer people deferred ART (2\% and 16\% did not start same-day). Two of the four studies were conducted sequentially; proven viral load suppression at 8 months was 31\% when everyone with tuberculosis symptoms had ART deferred, and 44\% when the algorithm was changed so that some people with tuberculosis symptoms could start same-day ART.
CONCLUSIONS: Although tuberculosis symptoms are very common in people starting ART, there is insufficient evidence about whether presence of tuberculosis symptoms should lead to ART start being deferred or not. Research to inform clear guidelines would help to maximise the benefits of same-day ART.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Scale-up of HIV self-testing (HIVST) will play a key role in meeting the United Nation's 90-90-90 targets. Delayed re-reading of used HIVST devices has been used by early implementation studies to validate the performance of self-test kits and to estimate HIV positivity among self-testers. We investigated the stability of results on used devices under controlled conditions to assess its potential as a quality assurance approach for HIVST scale-up.
METHODS: 444 OraQuick® HIV-1/2 rapid antibody tests were conducted using commercial plasma from two HIV-positive donors and HIV-negative plasma (high-reactive n = 148, weak-reactive n = 148 and non-reactive n = 148) and incubated them for six months under four conditions (combinations of high and low temperatures and humidity). Devices were re-read daily for one week, weekly for one subsequent month and then once a month by independent readers unaware of the previous results. We used multistage transition models to investigate rates of change in device results, and between storage conditions.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was a high incidence of device instability. Forty-three (29\%) of 148 initially non-reactive results became false weak-reactive results. These changes were observed across all incubation conditions, the earliest on Day 4 (n = 9 kits). No initially HIV-reactive results changed to a non-reactive result. There were no significant associations between storage conditions and hazard of results transition. We observed substantial statistical agreement between independent re-readers over time (agreement range: 0.74 to 0.96).
CONCLUSIONS: Delayed re-reading of used OraQuick® HIV-1/2 rapid antibody tests is not currently a valid methodological approach to quality assurance and monitoring as we observed a high incidence (29\%) of true non-reactive tests changing to false weak-reactive and therefore its use may overestimate true HIV positivity.},

SETTING: This prospective cohort study in South Africa investigated whether HIV infection was associated with impaired fracture healing after trauma.
METHODS: All adults with acute tibia and femur fractures who underwent intermedullary (IM) nailing for fracture fixation between September 2017 and December 2018, at 2 tertiary hospitals, were followed up for a minimum of 12 months postoperatively. The primary outcome was delayed bone union at 6 months (defined by the radiological union scoring system for the tibia score {\textless}9), and the secondary outcome was nonunion (defined as radiological union scoring system for the tibia score {\textless}9) at 9 months. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to investigate the associations between HIV status and impaired fracture healing.
RESULTS: In total, 358 participants, who underwent 395 IM nailings, were enrolled in the study and followed up for 12 months. Seventy-one of the 358 (19.8\%) participants were HIV-positive [83/395 (21\%) IM nailings]. HIV was not associated with delayed fracture healing after IM nailing of the tibia or femur (multivariable odds ratio: 1.06; 95\% confidence interval: 0.50 to 2.22). HIV-positive participants had a statistically significant lower odds ratio of nonunion compared with HIV-negative participants (multivariable odds ratio: 0.17; 95\% confidence interval: 0.01 to 0.92).
CONCLUSIONS: Fractures sustained in HIV-positive individuals can undergo surgical fixation as effectively as those in HIV-negative individuals, with no increased risk of delayed union or nonunion.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Although HIV infection and its associated co-morbidities remain the commonest reason for hospitalisation in Africa, their impact on economic costs and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are not well understood. This information is essential for decision-makers to make informed choices about how to best scale-up anti-retroviral treatment (ART) programmes. This study aimed to quantify the impact of HIV infection and ART on economic outcomes in a prospective cohort of hospitalised patients with high HIV prevalence.
METHODS: Sequential medical admissions to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Malawi, between June-December 2014 were followed until discharge, with standardised classification of medical diagnosis and estimation of healthcare resources used. Primary costing studies estimated total health provider cost by medical diagnosis. Participants were interviewed to establish direct non-medical and indirect costs. Costs were adjusted to 2014 US\$ and INT\$. HRQoL was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D. Multivariable analyses estimated predictors of economic outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 892 eligible participants, 80.4\% (647/892) were recruited and medical notes found. In total, 447/647 (69.1\%) participants were HIV-positive, 339/447 (75.8\%) were on ART prior to admission, and 134/647 (20.7\%) died in hospital. Mean duration of admission for HIV-positive participants not on ART and HIV-positive participants on ART was 15.0 days (95\%CI: 12.0-18.0) and 12.2 days (95\%CI: 10.8-13.7) respectively, compared to 10.8 days (95\%CI: 8.8-12.8) for HIV-negative participants. Mean total provider cost per hospital admission was US\$74.78 (bootstrap 95\%CI: US\$25.41-US\$124.15) higher for HIV-positive than HIV-negative participants. Amongst HIV-positive participants, the mean total provider cost was US\$106.87 (bootstrap 95\%CI: US\$25.09-US\$106.87) lower for those on ART than for those not on ART. The mean total direct non-medical and indirect cost per hospital admission was US\$87.84. EQ-5D utility scores were lower amongst HIV-positive participants, but not significantly different between those on and not on ART.
CONCLUSIONS: HIV-related hospital care poses substantial financial burdens on health systems and patients; however, per-admission costs are substantially lower for those already initiated onto ART prior to admission. These potential cost savings could offset some of the additional resources needed to provide universal access to ART.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Impressive achievements have been made towards achieving universal coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the effects of rapid ART scale-up on delays between HIV diagnosis and treatment initiation have not been well described.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study covering eight years of ART initiators (2004-2011) was conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi. The time between most recent positive HIV test and ART initiation was calculated and temporal trends in delay to initiation were described. Factors associated with time to initiation were investigated using multivariate regression analysis.
RESULTS: From 2004-2011, there were 15,949 ART initiations at QECH (56\% female; 8\% children [0-10 years] and 5\% adolescents [10-20 years]). Male initiators were likely to have more advanced HIV infection at initiation than female initiators (70\% vs. 64\% in WHO stage 3 or 4). Over the eight years studied, there were declines in treatment delay, with 2011 having the shortest delay at 36.5 days. On multivariate analysis CD4 count {\textless}50 cells/μl (adjusted geometric mean ratio [aGMR]: aGMR: 0.53, bias-corrected accelerated [BCA] 95\% CI: 0.42-0.68) was associated with shorter ART treatment delay. Women (aGMR: 1.12, BCA 95\% CI: 1.03-1.22) and patients diagnosed with HIV at another facility outside QECH (aGMR: 1.61, BCA 95\% CI: 1.47-1.77) had significantly longer treatment delay.
CONCLUSIONS: Continued improvements in treatment delays provide evidence that universal access to ART can be achieved using the public health approach adopted by Malawi However, the longer delays for women and patients diagnosed at outlying sites emphasises the need for targeted interventions to support equitable access for these groups.},

This prospective trial in seven high tuberculosis burden countries evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the point-of-care urine-based lipoarabinomannan assay FUJIFILM SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM) among inpatients and outpatients living with HIV. Diagnostic performance of FujiLAM was assessed against a mycobacterial reference standard (sputum culture, blood culture, and Xpert Ultra from urine and sputum at enrollment, and additional sputum culture ≤7 days from enrollment), an extended mycobacterial reference standard (eMRS), and a composite reference standard including clinical evaluation. Of 1637 participants considered for the analysis, 296 (18\%) were tuberculosis positive by eMRS. Median age was 40 years, median CD4 cell count was 369 cells/ul, and 52\% were female. Overall FujiLAM sensitivity was 54·4\% (95\% CI: 48·7-60·0), overall specificity was 85·2\% (83·2-87·0) against eMRS. Sensitivity and specificity estimates varied between sites, ranging from 26·5\% (95\% CI: 17·4\%-38·0\%) to 73·2\% (60·4\%-83·0\%), and 75·0 (65·0\%-82·9\%) to 96·5 (92·1\%-98·5\%), respectively. Post-hoc exploratory analysis identified significant variability in the performance of the six FujiLAM lots used in this study. Lot variability limited interpretation of FujiLAM test performance. Although results with the current version of FujiLAM are too variable for clinical decision-making, the lipoarabinomannan biomarker still holds promise for tuberculosis diagnostics. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04089423).},

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis. We searched Medline, Embase and the Global Index Medicus from inception to 16 May 2023. We included studies that assessed for at least one non-communicable disease among household contacts of people with clinical tuberculosis. We estimated the non-communicable disease prevalence through mixed effects logistic regression for studies providing individual participant data, and compared it with estimates from aggregated data meta-analyses. Furthermore, we compared age and sex-standardised non-communicable disease prevalence with national-level estimates standardised for age and sex.
RESULTS: We identified 39 eligible studies, of which 14 provided individual participant data (29,194 contacts). Of the remaining 25 studies, 18 studies reported aggregated data suitable for aggregated data meta-analysis. In individual participant data analysis, the pooled prevalence of diabetes in studies that undertook biochemical testing was 8.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 5.1\%-14.9\%, four studies). Age-and sex-standardised prevalence was higher in two studies (10.4\% vs. 6.9\% and 11.5\% vs. 8.4\%) than the corresponding national estimates and similar in two studies. Prevalence of diabetes mellitus based on self-report or medical records was 3.4\% (95\% CI 2.6\%-4.6\%, 14 studies). Prevalence did not significantly differ compared to estimates from aggregated data meta-analysis. There were limited data for other non-communicable diseases.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of diabetes mellitus among household contacts was high while that of known diabetes was substantially lower, suggesting the underdiagnosis. tuberculosis household contact investigation offers opportunities to deliver multifaceted interventions to identify tuberculosis infection and disease, screen for non-communicable diseases and address shared risk factors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD4 measurement is pivotal in the management of advanced HIV disease. VISITECT® CD4 Advanced Disease (AccuBio Limited, Alva, UK; VISITECT) is an instrument-free, point-of-care, semi-quantitative test allowing visual identification of a CD4 ≤200 cells/µl, or {\textgreater}200 cells/µl from finger-prick or venous blood.
METHODS: As part of a diagnostic accuracy study of FUJIFILM SILVAMP TB LAM (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04089423), people living with HIV of ≥18 years old were prospectively recruited in seven countries from outpatient departments if a tuberculosis symptom was present, and from inpatient departments. Participants provided venous blood for CD4 measurement using flow cytometry (reference standard) and finger-prick blood for VISITECT (index text), performed at point-of-care. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of VISITECT to determine a CD4 ≤200 cells/µl were evaluated.
RESULTS: Among 1604 participants, the median flow cytometry CD4 was 367 (IQR 128-626) cells/µl and 521 (32.5\%) had a CD4 ≤200 cells/µl. VISITECT sensitivity was 92.7\% (483/521, 95\% CI 90.1-94.7\%) and specificity was 61.4\% (665/1083, 95\% CI 58.4-64.3\%). For participants with a CD4 between 0-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-500, and {\textgreater}500 cells/µl, VISITECT misclassified 4.5\% (95\% CI 2.5-7.2\%), 12.5 (95\% CI 8.0-18.2\%), 74.1\% (95\% CI 67.0-80.5\%), 48.0\% (95\% CI 42.5-53.6\%), and 22.6\% (95\% CI 19.3-26.3\%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: VISITECT's sensitivity, but not specificity, met the World Health Organization's minimal sensitivity and specificity threshold of 80\% for point-of-care CD4 tests. VISITECT's quality needs to be assessed and its accuracy optimized. VISITECT´s utility as CD4 triage test should be investigated.},

	abstract = {Diagnosing and treating people with bacteriologically-negative but radiologically-apparent tuberculosis (TB) may contribute to more effective TB care and reduce transmission. However, optimal treatment approaches for this group are unknown. It is important to understand peoples' preferences of treatment options for effective programmatic implementation of people-centred treatment approaches. We designed and implemented a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to solicit treatment preferences among adults (≥18 years) with TB symptoms attending a primary health clinic in Blantyre, Malawi. Treatment attributes included in the DCE were as follows: duration of treatment; number of tablets per dose; reduction in the risk of being unwell with TB disease; likelihood of infecting others; adverse effects from the treatment; frequency of follow up; and the annual travel cost to access care. Quantitative choice modelling with multinomial logit models estimated through frequentist and Bayesian approaches investigated preferences for the management of bacteriologically-negative, but radiographically-apparent TB. 128 participants were recruited (57\% male, 43.8\% HIV-positive, 8.6\% previously treated for TB). Participants preferred to take any treatment compared to not taking treatment (odds ratio [OR] 5.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 2.40, 13.90). Treatments that reduced the relative risk of developing TB disease by 80\% were preferred (OR: 2.97; 95\% CI: 2.09, 4.21) compared to treatments that lead to a lower reduction in risk of 50\%. However, there was no evidence for treatments that are 95\% effective being preferred over those that are 80\% effective. Participants strongly favoured the treatments that could completely stop transmission (OR: 7.87, 95\% CI: 5.71, 10.84), and prioritised avoiding side effects (OR: 0.19, 95\% CI: 0.12, 0.29). There was no evidence of an interaction between perceived TB disease risk and treatment preferences. In summary, participants were primarily concerned with the effectiveness of TB treatments and strongly preferred treatments that removed the risk of onward transmission. Person-centred approaches of preferences for treatment should be considered when designing new treatment strategies. Understanding treatment preferences will ensure that any recommended treatment for probable early TB disease is well accepted and utilized by the public.},

To examine the effectiveness of one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine on care-home residents.
Study design
Natural experiment.
Methods
We compared the effectiveness of single doses of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 (effective at 10 days) and AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 (effective at 14 days) vaccines in vaccinated and control (unvaccinated) homes. Using routine data, all care-homes reporting COVID-19 outbreaks between 11/12/2020 and 12/3/2021 in a sub-region of North West England were included.
Results
Of 126 care-homes (4042 residents), with outbreaks, 55 (44\%, 1686 residents) reported onset dates before vaccination commenced; 38 (30\%, 1304 residents) reported onset {\textless} 10 (BNT162b2) and {\textless} 14 days (ChAdOx1) after vaccine administration; and 33 (26\%, 1052 residents) reported onset {\textgreater} 10 (BNT162b2) and {\textgreater} 14 (ChAdOx1) days after vaccination. Eighty-nine (71\%) homes used ChAdOx1 vaccine. A single dose of vaccine before the outbreak onset significantly lowered the risk of symptoms (reduced by 48\%), positivity (by 65\%), hospitalisation (by 68\%), and death (by 81\%). Some vaccine effectiveness was also noted in care-homes that received one dose of vaccine within 10–14 days of outbreak onset. The number needed to vaccinate to prevent one resident from COVID-19-related hospitalisation was 34, and death was 17.
Conclusions
This real-world, natural experiment adds to the evidence of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness from different studies using varying designs. In the context of lockdown's impact on infection rates and on-going care-home outbreaks, a single dose of either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccine had a significant impact on reducing COVID-19 related hospitalisation and death in care-home residents. Natural experiments should be used more in public health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Undiagnosed HIV and schistosomiasis are highly prevalent among fishermen in the African Great Lakes region. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lakeside interventions integrating services for HIV and male genital schistosomiasis on the prevalence of schistosomiasis, uptake of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV, and voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC) among fishermen in Malawi.
METHODS: We conducted a three-arm, cluster-randomised trial in 45 lakeshore fishing communities (clusters) in Mangochi, Malawi. Clusters were defined geographically by their home community as the place where fishermen leave their boats (ie, a landing site). Eligible participants were male fishermen (aged ≥18 years) who resided in a cluster. Clusters were randomly allocated (1:1:1) through computer-generated random numbers to either enhanced standard of care (SOC), which offered invitation with information leaflets to a beach clinic offering HIV testing and referral, and presumptive treatment for schistosomiasis with praziquantel; peer education (PE), in which a nominated fisherman was responsible for explaining the study leaflet to promote services to his boat crew; or peer distribution education (PDE), in which the peer educator explained the leaflet and distributed HIV self-test kits to his boat crew. The beach clinic team and fishermen were not masked to intervention allocation; however, investigators were masked until the final analysis. Coprimary composite outcomes were the proportion of participants who had at least one Schistosoma haematobium egg observed on light microscopy from 10 mL of urine filtrate and the proportion who had self-reported initiating ART or scheduling VMMC by day 28. Outcomes were analysed by intention to treat; multiple imputation for missing outcomes was done; random-effect binomial models adjusting for baseline imbalance and clustering were used to compute unadjusted and adjusted risk differences, risk ratios (RRs) and 95\% CIs, and intracluster correlation coefficients for each outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN14354324.
FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2022, and Jan 29, 2023, 45 (65·2\%) of 69 clusters assessed for eligibility were enrolled in the trial, with 15 clusters per arm. Of the 6036 fishermen screened at baseline, 5207 (86·3\%) were eligible for participation: 1745 (87·6\%) of 1991 in the enhanced SOC group, 1687 (81·9\%) of 2061 in the PE group, and 1775 (89·5\%) of 1984 in the PDE group. Compared with the prevalence of active schistosomiasis in the enhanced SOC group (292 [16·7\%] of 1745), 241 (13·6\%) of 1775 fishermen in the PDE group (adjusted RR 0·80 [95\% CI 0·69-0·94]; p=0·0054) and 263 (15·6\%) of 1687 fishermen in the PE group (0·92 [0·79-1·07]; p=0·28) had schistosomiasis at day 28. 230 (13·2\%) in the enhanced SOC group, 281 (16·7\%) in the PE group, and 215 (12·1\%) in the PDE group initiated ART or were scheduled for VMMC. ART initiation or VMMC scheduling was not significantly increased with the PDE intervention (0·88 [0·74-1·05); p=0·15) and was marginally increased with the PE intervention (1·16 [0·99-1·37]; p=0·069) when compared with the enhanced SOC group. No serious adverse events were reported in this trial.
INTERPRETATION: We found weak evidence for the use of peer education to increase uptake of ART and VMMC, but strong evidence for the added distribution of HIV self-test kits to promote high engagement with services and reduce the prevalence of active schistosomiasis, suggesting a high potential for scale-up in hard-to-reach communities across Malawi.

However, guidelines for the investigation and care of symptomatic TB-survivors are limited. We used qualitative methods to explore patient and provider understandings, experience and practice around respiratory symptoms in the post-TB period. We conducted in-depth interviews with PTB-survivors who had experienced respiratory symptoms (cough, chest pain, breathlessness) after successful TB treatment completion in Blantyre, Malawi (n = 23). We completed focus group discussions with TB-Officers (n = 12), and in-depth interviews with health care workers (n = 18) from primary and tertiary health facilities. Interviews were conducted in Chichewa, and thematic analysis was used to identify common themes. Our data highlight that TB survivors have negative experiences of respiratory symptoms after TB treatment completion, with anxiety about the cause of symptoms, uncertainty about if and how to return to care, and fear of recurrent TB disease. Our findings suggest four critical practices which shape this experience including: limited counselling at TB treatment completion; the lack of clear health seeking pathways to return to care; the use of TB-focused investigations for those returning to care; and heterogeneous approaches to TB retreatment decisions. This study highlights that the post-TB period is a critical part of the patient's experience of TB disease. Current practices create a negative patient experience, and carry clinical and public health risks including delayed diagnosis of TB relapse, missed diagnosis of cardio-respiratory disease, and misuse of antimicrobials and TB retreatment. Formative guidelines are needed to improve the care of symptomatic TB-survivors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Community active case finding (ACF) for tuberculosis was widely implemented in Europe and North America between 1940 and 1970, when incidence was comparable to many present-day high-burden countries. Using an interrupted time series analysis, we analysed the effect of the 1957 Glasgow mass chest X-ray campaign to inform contemporary approaches to screening.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Case notifications for 1950 to 1963 were extracted from public health records and linked to demographic data. We fitted Bayesian multilevel regression models to estimate annual relative case notification rates (CNRs) during and after a mass screening intervention implemented over 5 weeks in 1957 compared to the counterfactual scenario where the intervention had not occurred. We additionally estimated case detection ratios and incidence. From 11 March 1957 to 12 April 1957, 714,915 people (622,349 of 819,301 [76.0\%] resident adults ≥15 years) were screened with miniature chest X-ray; 2,369 (0.4\%) were diagnosed with tuberculosis. Pre-intervention (1950 to 1956), pulmonary CNRs were declining at 2.3\% per year from a CNR of 222/100,000 in 1950. With the intervention in 1957, there was a doubling in the pulmonary CNR (RR: 1.95, 95\% uncertainty interval [UI] [1.81, 2.11]) and 35\% decline in the year after (RR: 0.65, 95\% UI [0.59, 0.71]). Post-intervention (1958 to 1963) annual rates of decline (5.4\% per year) were greater (RR: 0.77, 95\% UI [0.69, 0.85]), and there were an estimated 4,599 (95\% UI [3,641, 5,683]) pulmonary case notifications averted due to the intervention. Effects were consistent across all city wards and notifications declined in young children (0 to 5 years) with the intervention. Limitations include the lack of data in historical reports on microbiological testing for tuberculosis, and uncertainty in contributory effects of other contemporaneous interventions including slum clearances, introduction of BCG vaccination programmes, and the ending of postwar food rationing.
CONCLUSIONS: A single, rapid round of mass screening with chest X-ray (probably the largest ever conducted) likely resulted in a major and sustained reduction in tuberculosis case notifications. Synthesis of evidence from other historical tuberculosis screening programmes is needed to confirm findings from Glasgow and to provide insights into ongoing efforts to successfully implement ACF interventions in today's high tuberculosis burden countries and with new screening tools and technologies.},

	abstract = {Urgent improvements in the diagnosis and management of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection are required to reach End TB goals. Conventional interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus), require substantial laboratory infrastructure and large blood volumes, limiting use in high-burden settings. The QIAreach QuantiFERON-TB (QIAreach QFT) was developed to overcome these challenges but has not previously been evaluated in field conditions in a low-income, high-burden country, or at scale in children. We performed a diagnostic evaluation of QIAreach QFT against QFT-Plus, in a cross-sectional IGRA survey in Blantyre, Malawi. We recruited a population-representative sample of children aged 1-4 years and adolescents and adults aged 10-40 years, from households and primary care. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and Cohen's kappa for QIAreach QFT against QFT-Plus, and constructed Bayesian hurdle-categorical models to compare quantitative test results. A total of 1,049 participants were recruited (64\%: 1-4 years; 13\%: 10-19 years; and 23\%: 20-40 years). More participants had a positive QIAreach QFT result (32\%) compared to QFT-Plus (15\%). Over half of positive QIAreach QFT results had time-to-positivity of exactly 20 min, the assay cutoff. There was minimal agreement between QFT-Plus and QIAreach QFT results (κ = 0.26), which was lowest in children aged 1-4 years (κ = 0.13). Sensitivity and specificity of QIAreach QFT relative to QFT-Plus were 62\% and 74\%, respectively, with poor correlation between quantitative results. The suboptimal performance of QIAreach QFT, particularly in young children, suggests that it cannot currently be recommended for wider use and that the urgent need for an accessible test of Mtb infection remains unmet.
IMPORTANCE: Almost a quarter of the world's population has evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Monitoring and addressing this substantial burden of so-called "latent" tuberculosis (TB) infection will be critical to reach End TB targets. However, current interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for Mtb infection are costly, and require a large volume of venous blood and significant laboratory processing, which are major barriers to their wider use in low-income countries. The novel QIAreach QuantiFERON-TB (QIAreach) assay has been designed as a more accessible alternative. We sought to evaluate it against a reference standard of QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, in a large cross-sectional survey in Blantyre, Malawi. To our knowledge, this is the first diagnostic evaluation of QIAreach QFT to be performed in a population-based survey in a low-income high-incidence setting, and to specifically focus on young children (a priority group for interventions targeting Mtb infection). In contrast to previous studies in other settings, we observed poor performance of QIAreach QFT, particularly in young children where there was little correlation between the novel test and the reference standard. This leads us to conclude that this test cannot be widely recommended for use in its current form; indeed manufacture is currently suspended. We believe our findings are of urgent importance to policymakers, clinicians, and researchers and underscore the importance of careful evaluation of new diagnostics in the contexts where they are intended to be used.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diagnostic delays for tuberculosis are common, with high resultant mortality. Urine-Xpert Ultra (Cepheid) could improve time to diagnosis of tuberculosis disease and rifampicin resistance. We previously reported on lot-to-lot variation of the Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM. In this prespecified secondary analysis of the same cohort, we aimed to determine the diagnostic yield and accuracy of Urine-Xpert Ultra for tuberculosis in people with HIV, compared with an extended microbiological reference standard (eMRS) and composite reference standard (CRS) and also compared with Determine TB LAM Ag (AlereLAM, Abbott).
METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, diagnostic accuracy study, we recruited consecutive inpatients and outpatients (aged ≥18 years) with HIV from 13 hospitals and clinics in seven countries (Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Viet Nam, and Zambia). Patients with no isoniazid preventive therapy in the past 6 months and fewer than three doses of tuberculosis treatment in the past 60 days were included. Reference and index testing was performed in real time. The primary outcome of this secondary analysis was the diagnostic yield and accuracy of Urine-Xpert Ultra compared with the eMRS and CRS. Diagnostic accuracy was compared with AlereLAM and diagnostic yield was compared with both AlereLAM and Sputum-Xpert Ultra. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04089423, and is complete.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 13, 2019, and Aug 5, 2021, 3528 potentially eligible individuals were screened and 1731 were enrolled, of whom 1602 (92·5\%) were classifiable by the eMRS (median age 40 years [IQR 33-48], 838 [52·3\%] of 1602 were female, 764 [47·7\%] were male, 937 [58·5\%] were outpatients, 665 [41·5\%] were inpatients, median CD4 count was 374 cells per μL [IQR 138-630], and 254 [15·9\%] had microbiologically confirmed tuberculosis). Against eMRS as reference, sensitivities of Urine-Xpert Ultra and AlereLAM were 32·7\% (95\% CI 27·2-38·7) and 30·7\% (25·4-36·6) and specificities were 98·0\% (97·1-98·6) and 90·4\% (88·7-91·8), respectively. Against CRS as reference, sensitivities of Urine-Xpert Ultra and AlereLAM were 21·1\% (95\% CI 17·6-25·1), and 30·5\% (26·4-34·9), and specificities were 99·1\% (98·3-99·6) and 95·1\% (93·5-96·3), respectively. The combination of Sputum-Xpert Ultra with AlereLAM or Urine-Xpert Ultra diagnosed 202 (77·1\%) and 204 (77·9\%) of 262 eMRS-positive participants, respectively, in incompletely overlapping groups; combining all three tests diagnosed 214 (81·7\%) of 262 eMRS-positive participants INTERPRETATION: Urine-Xpert Ultra could offer promising clinical utility in addition to AlereLAM and Sputum-Xpert Ultra. In inpatient settings where both AlereLAM and Urine-Xpert Ultra are possible, both should be offered to support rapid diagnosis and treatment.

	abstract = {BackgroundMore new infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) occur annually in the WHO African region than in the rest of the world combined. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in pregnant women and vertical transmission events in the region.MethodsIn this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Africa Index Medicus, and Africa Journals Online for publications between Jan 1, 1992, and Jan 7, 2024, with no language restrictions. HBsAg prevalence and vertical transmission (HBsAg positivity in children aged 6-12 months) were estimated with the use of binomial mixed models with logit links, stratified by infant vaccination status. We estimated HBsAg prevalence for subregions of Africa and for the WHO African region by weighting by estimated livebirths for each subregion. We estimated transmission events using WHO and UNICEF vaccine coverage data and UN population estimates.FindingsWe included 113 studies reporting on HBsAg prevalence from 190 983 pregnant women and 11 studies reporting on vertical transmission. HBsAg prevalence in women receiving antenatal care in the WHO African region (based on 2014-23 data) was 6·2\% (95\% CI 5·3-7·2). No relationship between risk of bias and HBsAg prevalence was observed. In 2022, an estimated 172 000 vertical transmission events (95\% CI 82 000-383 000) occurred (0·4\% of livebirths), a fall from a peak of 339 000 (149 000-634 000; 1·2\% of all livebirths) in 2001. Increasing birth dose vaccination coverage to the WHO target of 90\% could reduce vertical transmission by 43·7\% (95\% CI 11·6-78·0) to 97 000 events per year (95\% CI 58 000-160 000). Adding maternal antiviral prophylaxis with 90\% coverage could reduce transmission by 86·3\% (95\% CI 78·4-94·6) to 24 000 events per year (95\% CI 14 000-39 000; 0·06\% of livebirths) and achieve WHO elimination targets.InterpretationVertical transmission is an important contributor to HBV transmission in the WHO African region. Scaling up of hepatitis B birth dose vaccination and antiviral prophylaxis is urgently needed, which could achieve elimination of vertical transmission.FundingWellcome Trust.},

	abstract = {Substantial evidence demonstrates that men have a higher prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) and decreased use of TB services compared to women. Gender roles and norms contribute to these disparities by influencing social and structural determinants, as well as individual behaviours. In this analysis, we investigated attitudes towards gender equitable norms and TB testing behaviours amongst Malawian men and women participating in a prevalence survey conducted before a community-based TB active case finding trial in Blantyre. Perceptions of gender norms were captured through a modified version of the Gender Equitable Men Scale (GEMS). Gender inequitable views were prevalent among both men (56.1\%) and women (55.8\%). The association between a composite GEMS score and TB testing history was modelled using logistic regression, accounting for various sociodemographic covariates (age, sex, wealth quantile, education, and HIV status) (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI: 0.88-1.42, p=0.373). Bivariate analysis demonstrated no notable confounding by any covariates and no strong effect modification. While GEMS score had no association with TB testing history among women, men with higher GEMS scores (less gender-equitable views) were more likely to have been tested for TB across age groups. These findings provide a basis for future investigation into the patterns and motives TB behaviours, particularly in older men. Tailored public health strategies may then be implemented to address this important population.},

	abstract = {Delays in identifying and treating individuals with infectious tuberculosis (TB) contribute to poor health outcomes and allow ongoing community transmission of M. tuberculosis (Mtb). Current recommendations for screening for tuberculosis specify community characteristics (e.g., areas with high local tuberculosis prevalence) that can be used to target screening within the general population. However, areas of higher tuberculosis burden are not necessarily areas with higher rates of transmission. We investigated the transmission of Mtb using high-resolution surveillance data in Blantyre, Malawi. We extracted and performed whole genome sequencing on mycobacterial DNA from cultured M. tuberculosis isolates obtained from culture-positive tuberculosis cases at the time of tuberculosis (TB) notification in Blantyre, Malawi between 2015-2019. We constructed putative transmission networks identified using TransPhylo and investigated individual and pair-wise demographic, clinical, and spatial factors associated with person-to-person transmission. We found that 56\% of individuals with sequenced isolates had a probable transmission link to at least one other individual in the study. We identified thirteen putative transmission networks that included five or more individuals. Five of these networks had a single spatial focus of transmission in the city, and each focus centered in a distinct neighborhood in the city. We also found that approximately two-thirds of inferred transmission links occurred between individuals residing in different geographic zones of the city. While the majority of detected tuberculosis transmission events in Blantyre occurred between people living in different zones, there was evidence of distinct geographical concentration for five transmission networks. These findings suggest that targeted interventions in areas with evidence of localized transmission may be an effective local tactic, but will likely need to be augmented by city-wide interventions to improve case finding to have sustained impact.},

	abstract = {Background Globally, the burden of tuberculosis (TB) falls more on men than women and children, and there are large gaps between men and women at all stages of exposure, disease incidence, and treatment. We examined the impact of addressing determinants of these gender gaps in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, and Uganda. Methods and Findings We created a deterministic transmission model of TB, with strata for sex, age, and HIV co-infection and antiretroviral therapy, and calibrated to country-specific data on prevalence, incidence, mortality, and notifications between 2010 and 2022. We then examined the potential epidemiological impact of strategies to increase treatment coverage among men, and decrease the effects of social and structural determinants that increase men’s risk of developing TB. We investigated impact (overall and by age and sex) on projected incidence and mortality in 2035, and notification rates between 2025 and 2030. Relative reductions in overall TB incidence from increased treatment coverage among men ranged from 4.8\% [95\% uncertainty interval (UI)0.7-10.6\%] in Malawi to 24.8\% [UI 14.3-37.0\%] in Uganda. Reducing men’s excess risk of TB led to a similar range in relative reductions from 8.4\% [UI 6.6-10.4\%] in Nigeria to 23.3\% [UI 18.0-30.0\%] in Uganda. Combining strategies increased the relative reduction beyond that seen with one strategy alone, but as would be anticipated by greater prevention of incident TB, less than the sum of both strategies. Impacts extended across the population with median estimates of country-level declines in incidence of between 1.6—10.6\% and 2.8—19.5\% in women and children respectively, across the four countries. Increasing treatment coverage increased the median country-level estimates of notifications between 3.1\% and 12.4\% in the first three years, however combining increased treatment coverage with a reduction in risk reduced the median annual country-level notifications by 6.7\% to 18.1\% by 2035. Conclusion Strategies that prioritise increasing TB treatment coverage among men and mitigating men’s higher susceptibility to TB could reduce disease burden for men, women, and children. Such gender-responsive strategies are essential to ensure a person-centred TB response and accelerate global progress towards the End TB targets.},

	abstract = {BackgroundDespite improved access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-related morbidity and mortality remain high. A previous review (2007-14) found that AIDS-related illnesses were the leading causes of hospitalisations. We aimed to summarise the causes of hospitalisations among people living with HIV from 2014 to 2023.MethodsFor this meta-analysis we searched eight databases (Ovid Medline ALL, Ovid Embase Classic and Ovid Embase, Ovid Global Health, EBSCOhost CINAHL Complete, EBSCOhost Africa-Wide Information, Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Content, Clarivate Analytics Web of Science SciELO, and Global Index Medicus) on April 26, 2023. We included studies of any design that reported on the cause of admission to hospital for at least 20 people after Jan 1, 2014. We extracted summary-level data about CD4 cell counts, ART use, cause of admission, and incidence of death, and assessed risk of bias with the use of a modified Newcastle-Ottowa Scale. We constructed random effects models to estimate prevalence of various diseases as a cause of hospital admission.FindingsFrom the 19 629 records identified, we obtained data from 110 studies representing 100 628 hospital admissions. The weighted median CD4 count was 111 cells per μL (range of medians 25-713); 60\% of admissions (95\% Cl 54-66) were people receiving ART. The most common cause of admission was AIDS-related illnesses (42\% of admissions, 95\% CI 35-49), including tuberculosis (19\%, 15-23). The second most common cause was bacterial infection (26\%, 20-33). AIDS-related illnesses were more common in WHO regions of South and Central America (62\%, 53-71), Africa (49\%, 39-60), Western Pacific (68\%, 57-77), and South-East Asia (40\%, 31-50) than in Europe (30\%, 23-37) and North America (13\%, 6-25). Wasting and parasitic infections were more common in children (malnutrition 31\%, 11-63; parasitic infection 13\%, 4-37) than in adults. In-hospital mortality was 17\% (13-20), with substantial regional variation.InterpretationOur results indicate providing high-quality care to hospitalised people with HIV-related conditions (AIDS-related illness and severe bacterial infections) should be prioritised.FundingThe Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},
